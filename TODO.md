## Concepts to Add

- **Identity Precedes Action** — When someone is accused/attacked/banished, their identity can shift ("I'm a predator," "I'm banished") and that drives their actions. If their identity stays "I'm someone who can shape this outcome," they take different actions. This concept should go somewhere — possibly in "Decline False Responsibility" or "When You've Been Wronged" once that's fleshed out. The distinction itself is valuable; the generic omnipotence teaching around it is not.
