Ideas and concepts that are useful but didn't make it into the book (yet). This file is for the author's reference—not published.

## Deferred Concepts

### Intentional Malice Page
A page specifically for people who intentionally harmed others and later feel remorse. The user knows people who've raped others and later came around to wanting to act better. This psychology is complex and not well understood—may require more research before writing.

**Why deferred:** Not qualified to write on this yet. The book works without it by implicitly targeting people with good intent.

---

### Response Mistakes as a Formal Category
The idea that "response mistakes" could be their own category in the Types of Mistakes matrix—distinct from the original action.

**Why deferred:** The current framework already covers it. A response IS an action, so it fits in the existing matrix. You just apply the matrix to your response rather than the original incident. Adding a separate category might overcomplicate things.

### Deeper Explanation of Why Over-Responses Happen
A more detailed breakdown of the psychology behind over-responses:
1. Harmful belief (you believed they were a predator when they weren't)
2. Emotional indulgence (you knew you were going too far but anger felt justified)
3. Filters/trauma (your past made you see HIGH when it was MEDIUM or LOW)

**Why deferred:** This is already covered in Trauma & Filters and the harmful belief framework. Added a brief linking sentence to the Over-Response section instead of duplicating content.
