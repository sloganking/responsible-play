- Manipulation via guilt and character attacks
- The "you should have just known" tactic (later admitted as bullshit)
- The cost of not setting a boundary and leaving
- Clarity through contrast (experiencing the opposite of what you want)

## Potential Placement
Could work as an example in:
- Fawning section

## The Story

At a festival, reconnected with a woman (Woman A) I'd met a month before. We had romantic feelings, decided to share sensuality together. We were both openly polyamorous and non-monogamous—I thought that was enough context.

We did a cacao body painting workshop together. Afterwards, during lunch, I met another woman (Woman B), we hit it off, I gave her a kiss.

Woman A saw this and felt profoundly jealous. She asked if I would not romantically see any other women at the festival—she wanted me to only connect with her.

I closed my eyes, felt into it, and recognized I couldn't make that feel good. I had a self-agreement not to close myself off if someone asked. So I said no—I'm not available for closing myself off and only seeing you during this festival.

Her immediate response: "So you're just some pleasure-seeking, selfish asshole then?"

I was stunned. I'd stated I was open and non-monogamous upfront. So was she. I wasn't expecting her to want me to close. She never communicated that's what she wanted. Now my character was being attacked because I upheld an honest boundary.

I was still in my pleasing phase. I wanted her to be happy. I felt susceptible to her guilt. So I tried to please her—didn't close, but spent two or three days having three-hour "repair" conversations.

They didn't go well. She didn't listen to anything I said. She just accused me of being a selfish asshole.

**What I should have done:** As soon as she insulted me, set a boundary: "You may not speak to me this way. If you continue, I'm going to have to reconsider my interest in engaging with you." And if she continued, leave.

Instead, I fawned for days.

Her recurring accusation: "The cacao ceremony was so intimate, you should have just *known* you shouldn't kiss another woman soon afterwards."

My response: How was I supposed to know? You hadn't communicated any boundaries. We're both poly. This doesn't happen with anyone else. Why am I supposed to assume this with you?

Eventually, she admitted: The "you should have known" thing was bullshit. She was just jealous and upset.

So this thing I'd been defending against for days was manipulation.

## The Contrast Insight

Being around this woman who attacked me and guilted me at every turn for maintaining my boundaries—it showed me in my body: *This is literally the exact opposite of what I want.*

What I want: A loving, open, compersion-filled woman who enjoys my happiness and pleasure. Someone whose love is win-win, not win-lose.

What she offered: Change yourself. Close yourself off. Do what I want, not what you want. Her love was a win-lose proposition—I couldn't give her what she wanted without losing myself.

Later, I found women who either loved me freely or, when I was down, treated me with compassion and cared about my feelings.

The contrast made it crystal clear: *This is what I fucking want.* Because I'd just experienced exactly what I don't want.

## Key Patterns

1. **Fawning cost:** 6-9 hours of painful, unproductive conversation because I didn't set a boundary and leave
2. **Manipulation tactic:** "You should have just known" — attacking someone for not reading your mind, later admitting it was just emotion
3. **Boundary attack:** Stating boundaries clearly upfront, then being attacked for maintaining them
4. **Clarity through contrast:** Experiencing the opposite of what you want shows you clearly what you do want
