# Inquisitor Section — Points to Include

**Target location:** `before-you-judge.md`, new section after "The Witch Hunt Dynamic"

---

## Core Points

1. **The Inquisition as flagship example**
   - Inquisition, Crusades, witch trials — all operated on sincere belief
   - They genuinely thought they were protecting souls, families, God, civilization
   - Torturing people to "save them from hell" — they believed this was love

2. **"Goodness without wisdom creates evil" — the extreme case**
   - These weren't evil people doing evil
   - They were good people with distorted perception causing massive harm
   - Supreme goodness + zero wisdom = the equation that produces atrocities

3. **Witch hunts never ended**
   - We just swap the label: "witch" → "heretic" → "communist" → "predator"
   - The pattern is identical: scary story, fear activation, punishment without verification
   - Harm done in the name of protection

4. **Belief, not malice**
   - Most atrocities in history were committed by people who genuinely believed they were doing good
   - This is the terrifying part: being good isn't enough
   - You can be good and still be the monster

5. **The ISTA experience as modern parallel**
   - Someone attacked Logan operating on belief, not malice
   - Became the embodiment of the "toxic masculine" he was fighting against
   - Good person, distorted perception, real harm
   - Logan still saw him as fundamentally good but misguided, acting from fear

6. **The autopilot/training parallel**
   - Like handing your attacker the gun because that's what you trained (target focus training)
   - These patterns run automatically
   - The Inquisitor wasn't choosing evil — he was executing a program he believed was righteous

7. **The mirror for the reader**
   - If you're operating on belief without verifying reality, you could be the Inquisitor
   - You could be the witch hunter
   - You could be causing harm while feeling righteous
   - The feeling of righteousness is NOT evidence you're right
   - "The last time you judged someone — did you verify? Did you hear all sides? Or did you just feel righteous and act?"

## Tone Notes

- Not moralizing — describing what happens
- Make it inarguable — anyone should be able to read without feeling attacked
- The point is empowerment through awareness, not shame

## Related Connections

- Links to: Trauma & Filters (how the distortion works)
- Links to: "Never assume malice where belief will do" (already in trauma-and-filters.md)
- Links to: "Goodness without wisdom creates evil" (already in introduction.md)
- Parallels the target focus training example in structure (maximum-case illustration)

## Potential Additional Example: Circumcision

**The point:** Cultural beliefs make things feel "normal" even when they're objectively in the same category as things we call monstrous.

**The example:**
- FGM (pricking a clitoris) → called "genital mutilation," we despise countries that do it
- Circumcision (removing significant tissue with nerve endings from penis) → called "tradition," feels normal
- The word "circumcision" itself sanitizes the act — without it, we'd just say "cut part of the penis off"

**Why it works:**
- It's not "over there" — it's right here, in reader's own culture/body
- Reader might catch themselves: "I don't feel bad about circumcision... but logically..."
- That moment of catching yourself IS the lesson — that's the filter in action
- Demonstrates you can be a product of belief without knowing it

**Risk:**
- Politically charged — could derail into medical benefits debate
- Could feel like an attack on parents who chose it

**How to frame:**
- NOT "circumcision is bad" (moralizing)
- Instead: "Notice how differently you feel about these two things. That difference IS the filter."
- Use reader's differential reaction as evidence they're subject to the blindness
- Keep it brief — drop it, let it land, move on

**Potential placement:**
- Trauma & Filters (beliefs shaping perception)
- Before You Judge (how "normal" blinds us)
- Inquisitor section (modern parallel to historical blindness)
- Sidebar/callout so it doesn't derail main flow
