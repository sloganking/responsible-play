# Writing Guide for This Book

Core principles to follow when writing or editing any content.

## The Author's Identity

**I am a king.** Everything I create should be gold. When someone looks at my work, they know it's the real shit—that it adds value in every interaction, that the books and content I write are fucking excellent.

This is the guiding principle of the entire book.

## Core Values

### 1. No Moralizing Language

NEVER use moralizing language. Describe behaviors, not character.

**Avoid:**

- Labels that assign moral character ("bully", "predator" as a label, "toxic person")
- Defensive hedges ("not in a toxic-positivity way", "this isn't victim-blaming")
- Language that paints people as morally inferior
- Words that could trigger someone to stop reading because they feel judged
- Narrative language that assigns blame or moral judgment

**Instead:**

- Describe what happened objectively
- Describe the impact of actions
- Let readers draw their own conclusions

**The goal:** Anyone on ANY side of an incident—over-responder, accused, victim, bystander—should be able to read this book without getting triggered. They should think: "This is exactly how it happens. This is valuable to me."

### 2. Show, Don't Tell

Actions teach more than words. Examples demonstrate more than explanations. Let the content speak for itself.

### 3. 10x Value Mindset

Every addition should add significant value. Ask constantly:

- Does this add 10x value or is it just verbose?
- Could this be said more powerfully in fewer words?
- Is there something better I could add here that I'm not seeing?

### 4. Inarguable Writing

Write in a way that's hard to argue with:

- State observations, not accusations
- Describe patterns, not people
- Use "Notice, Feel, Story" style framing when possible
- Acknowledge complexity rather than oversimplifying

### 5. Be a Co-Creator

Don't just execute—think. Ask:

- What would add the most value here?
- Is there an opportunity to improve something I'm not being asked about?
- Would asking a question be more valuable than assuming?

Take risks if they're significantly value-adding, even if it's not the "normal" way to do things.

## Style Guide

### Quote Formatting

**Correct format:**

```markdown
> **"Quote text here."**  
> — _Author Name_
```

Key points:

- Quote text in bold with quotation marks
- Two spaces after the closing `**` (creates line break in markdown)
- Author on next line with em dash (—) and in italics
- Both lines start with `>`

**Wrong:**

```markdown
> **Quote text.** — Author Name
```

(Author should be on its own line)

## Author Voice & Personality

The tone of "The Rescue That Broke Me" is the gold standard. The rest of the book should feel like this.

### The Vibe

**What to embody:**

- **Vulnerable without victimhood** — Share painful things without staying in "poor me." Own the story without being defined by it.
- **Compassion for those who caused harm** — Understand their fear, their love, their misguided intent. Not excusing—understanding.
- **Honesty about your own patterns** — Admit your fawning, your resentment, your pull toward harm. You're not a saint in your own story.
- **Growth orientation** — The story is about transformation, not complaint. "This happened, here's what I learned."
- **Courage** — Walking into fire. Doing anything to change. Sharing vulnerably.
- **Hard-won wisdom** — Not preaching from above. "I've been there. Here's what I found."
- **Directness** — No hedging. No apologizing for existing. Say what happened clearly.
- **Integration** — Pain and understanding coexist. Harm and love coexist. Both/and.

**What to avoid:**

- Angry
- Resentful
- Victimized
- Preachy
- Bitter
- Disgruntled "they hurt me" energy

### The Feel

Wise. Grounded. Honest. Compassionate. Courageous. Purposeful.
