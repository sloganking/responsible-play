# Facilitator's Dilemma — Section Notes

Notes from conversation on Feb 16, 2026. To be written into the placeholder at `src/concepts/when-things-go-wrong.md` line 171.

## Core Principles

1. **Your service is a privilege, not an entitlement.** Facilitators should have clear conditions for engagement — just like "your touch is a privilege" applies to participants, "my service is a privilege" applies to facilitators. You don't owe someone your leadership while they're attacking you.

2. **Boundary first, pattern interrupt later.** When someone is in full rescuer rage, their conscious mind is offline. You cannot reach them with insight in that moment. The only moves are:
   - Set a boundary and disengage: "I'm willing to have this conversation when we can both be respectful. Right now, I'm not available for this."
   - Calm presence (Hormozi conviction — your groundedness either brings them down or it doesn't)
   - If neither works, leave/disengage completely
   - Pattern interrupts (Rich Litvin style) only work AFTER someone has calmed down, not during rage

3. **You can't save everyone in real-time.** Some people are so deep in their rescuer pattern that no intervention reaches them. "You can't force awakening" applies here.

4. **The fawning trap for facilitators.** Facilitators are especially vulnerable to fawning under attack because:
   - They feel responsible for the container
   - They feel they should "be the adult"
   - They're afraid of looking like they're using their authority to silence someone
   - Cultural pressure says "believe the accuser"
   - The result: fawning disguised as professionalism, followed by resentment

5. **Pre-established protocol is essential.** This must be decided BEFORE it happens:
   - Have a co-facilitator or named external person who handles accusations against the lead facilitator
   - Transparency about conflict of interest: "I've been accused. I have a conflict of interest in handling this. Here's who will handle it instead."
   - The existing rules (from Before You Facilitate) still apply to the accuser — rule #4 (using victim status as excuse to attack) and rule #5 (character assassination) don't stop applying just because the target is the facilitator
   - But enforcing them against someone accusing YOU looks like retaliation — which is why the co-facilitator matters

6. **The "emergency safety" exception** (already written in Before You Facilitate, line 397) — asking someone to leave temporarily for safety, with explanation, without affecting their future standing. This could apply here.

7. **The boundary line to memorize:** "I can hear you're upset. I want to work through this — but not like this. When you're ready to talk without attacking me, I'm here."

## What the Section Should Cover

- When you're the one being accused, you lose your neutral position — acknowledge that openly
- The structural fix (co-facilitator / external mediator)
- What to do in the moment (boundary + calm presence, not fawning)
- What NOT to do (fawn to appease, use authority to shut it down, try to pattern-interrupt someone in rage)
- The facilitator's right to not accept abuse while still honoring the accuser's pain
- When the facilitator fawns, it models that anger wins — reference the existing "What You're Modeling" section
- "Your service is a privilege" framing — conditions under which you serve
