# When You've Been Wronged

← [Back to Introduction](../introduction.md)

---

This section is for when **you** are the target of an over-response.

You made a mistake—maybe LOW, maybe MEDIUM. And someone responded with HIGH-severity aggression. Character assassination. Accusations of being a predator. Witch hunt energy. Reputation damage.

This is one of the most disorienting, painful experiences in these spaces. And there's almost no guidance for it anywhere.

Here's what I've learned.

## First: Name What Happened

You're not crazy. What happened to you is wrong.

When someone responds to a MEDIUM mistake with HIGH-severity punishment, **they are [abusing their power as a victim](./drama-triangle.md#victim)**.

Their over-response doesn't mean you're a predator. It means they over-responded.

These can both be true:

- You made a mistake (own it)
- Their response was disproportionate and harmful (that's on them)

You don't have to choose. You can hold both.

## In the Moment

### Don't Fawn

The temptation when someone is attacking you is to appease. To over-apologize. To admit to things that aren't true just to make them stop.

**Don't do this.**

Fawning under threat is not a real apology. And everything you say while fawning can be used against you later. "But you admitted it!"

You can acknowledge your actual mistake without accepting their distorted story about who you are.

> "I understand that what happened affected you, and I take responsibility for my part. But I'm not available for being called a predator. That's not what happened, and I won't agree to it."

### Set Boundaries About How You're Spoken To

You don't have to stand there and absorb abuse.

> "I'm open to having a conversation about what happened when you're ready to speak to me with respect. Until then, I'm not available for this."

Then disengage. You don't owe them your presence while they attack you.

### Remember: Their Response Is Data About Them

Their over-response tells you about **their patterns**, not your worth.

- It tells you they struggle with proportional response
- It tells you they may have [trauma filters](./trauma-and-filters.md) that distort their perception
- It tells you they might not be safe to be vulnerable with

This is painful information. But it's valuable. You now know something about who they are.

### Document What Actually Happened

While it's fresh, write down:

- What actually occurred (your best honest account)
- What they said/did
- Who witnessed what
- Timeline

You may never need this. But if accusations escalate, having a contemporaneous record matters.

## Afterward: The Emotional Reality

Let's be honest: **this will take time.**

Maybe weeks. Maybe months. There's no shortcut.

You've been attacked. Your character has been questioned. You may have been publicly shamed for something that doesn't match reality. That's grief. That's trauma. It doesn't just evaporate because you understand the framework.

### What Helps

**Find support from people who can hold nuance.**

Not people who will just tell you the other person is evil. Not people who will tell you that you're evil. People who can say: "That sounds really hard. You made a mistake AND their response was disproportionate. Both are true."

**Take responsibility for YOUR actual mistake—no more, no less.**

This is hard when you've been accused of being a monster. The temptation is either to:

- Accept their whole story ("maybe I AM a predator")
- Reject all responsibility ("I did nothing wrong!")

Neither serves you. Find the middle: "I made a MEDIUM mistake. I wish I hadn't. I've learned from it. AND their response was disproportionate and harmful to me."

**Use the reframes from this book.**

- Their over-response is them [abusing their power as a victim](./drama-triangle.md#victim)
- You can [rescind the privilege of your touch](./fawning.md#your-touch-is-a-privilege) from people who don't respect it
- Being attacked doesn't make you a predator any more than their accusations make them right
- You are still a [Creator](./drama-triangle.md#creator), not a Victim—you can choose how to respond

**Let yourself feel it.**

Anger, grief, confusion, shame—all of it. Don't rush to "get over it." The feelings are information. They're processing.

## What Actions To Take

### Don't Counter-Attack

It's tempting. They attacked you. You want to defend yourself, expose their hypocrisy, show everyone what really happened.

Usually, this backfires. It escalates. It looks like you're "attacking the victim." It gives them more ammunition.

**Exception:** If there's a formal process (mediation, community accountability, legal), participate honestly. But public counter-attacks usually hurt you more.

### Consider Whether to Communicate Directly

Sometimes a direct conversation helps. Sometimes it makes things worse.

Questions to ask:

- Are they capable of hearing you right now, or are they fully in Victim/Persecutor mode?
- Do you have a mediator or third party who can help?
- What's the best realistic outcome of this conversation?

If they're still activated and you're still activated, waiting might be wiser.

### Talk to Facilitators/Community Leadership

If this happened in a container, the facilitators should know your side. Not to start a counter-witch-hunt, but so they have full information.

A good facilitator will:

- Hear both sides
- Recognize proportionality
- Not automatically side with whoever cried loudest

If the facilitator only listens to the accuser, that tells you something about the facilitator.

### Decide About This Person Going Forward

You get to choose who has access to you.

This person has shown you they respond to mistakes with disproportionate aggression. They've shown you they may not be safe to be vulnerable with.

You don't have to forgive them. You don't have to reconcile. You can simply decide: this person doesn't get the privilege of my presence, my touch, my vulnerability anymore.

That's not bitterness. That's [taking responsibility](./responsibility.md) for your own safety.

## The Hardest Part

Here's what no one wants to say:

**Sometimes there's nothing you can do.**

Sometimes the witch hunt happens anyway. Sometimes your reputation takes a hit. Sometimes people believe them. Sometimes there's no justice, no vindication, no moment where everyone realizes you were treated unfairly.

This is reality. It sucks.

What you can control:

- How you respond
- Who you allow in your life going forward
- How you process and heal
- What you learn for the future

What you can't control:

- What they think
- What others believe
- Whether you get an apology

Focus on what you can control. Let go of what you can't. Not because it's fair—it isn't—but because holding onto it only extends your suffering.

## The Long View

Over time, truth tends to emerge.

People who over-respond once usually over-respond again. Their pattern becomes visible. Others start to notice.

Meanwhile, if you conduct yourself with integrity—taking responsibility for your actual mistakes without accepting false accusations—that becomes visible too.

You don't need to prove anything. Just keep being who you are. The people worth having in your life will see it.

## You're Not Alone

This happens more than people talk about. Many people in these spaces have experienced being on the wrong end of an over-response, a witch hunt, a disproportionate attack.

Most of them stay silent because speaking up risks being attacked again.

But know this: you're not the first. You're not alone. And the fact that it happened to you doesn't mean you're what they said you are.

Take responsibility for your actual mistakes. Reject the distortions. Heal. And keep going.
