## Definition of responsability

- What happened, how did my actions play a part in creating this outcome? What can I do in the future to create something else I want instead?

## On how to make it right after a mistake.

- Take responsability and ownership of what occured.
- If you're the primary agressor/mistake-maker then appologize with action, not just words.

In my classes, I'm teaching apologizing with action, which means making it right, not just saying I'm sorry and then leaving the other person hurt.

I don't know how to put this in a chart yet, but I want to go over limiting beliefs and primary questions like the one taught in Tony Robbins' Date with Destiny, basically showing people what like single sentence thing is running your life and tainting how you see everything in the world. Because whatever comes up, whatever mistake someone makes, you make it, they make it, you're going to view everything through your beliefs and filters which are not necessarily real.

Trauma. What that does in interactions. How to handle it responsibly when interacting with others.
You may not even know you have trauma. It may be just one of those subconscious filters you view the world through. A belief and narrative about the world and what happened to you.
