# Trauma & Filters

## The Problem

When a boundary violation occurs, what do you assume about the person who made it?

- Do you assume the best or the worst?
- What meaning do you ascribe to mistakes?
- Do you know you have trauma that causes your interpretations to lean a certain way?

## How Trauma Works in Interactions

Trauma creates subconscious filters. You may not even know you have trauma. It may just be one of those filters you view the world through.

**A belief and narrative about the world and what happened to you.**

Whatever comes up—whatever mistake someone makes, you make it, they make it—you're going to view everything through your beliefs and filters, **which are not necessarily real.**

## Limiting Beliefs & Primary Questions

(Concept from Tony Robbins' Date with Destiny)

There may be a single sentence running your life and tainting how you see everything in the world.

Examples:
- "People always hurt me"
- "I'm not safe"
- "Men/women can't be trusted"
- "I have to protect myself at all costs"

These filters will distort:
- How you interpret others' [types of mistakes](./types-of-mistakes.md)
- How you assess [severity](./severity.md)
- Whether your [response is appropriate](./appropriate-response.md)

## Responsibility When You Have Trauma

Having trauma is not your fault.

How you handle it when interacting with others IS your responsibility.

- Know your triggers
- Communicate them when possible
- Pause before reacting
- Ask: "Is this about NOW or about THEN?"
