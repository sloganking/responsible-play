## The Goal

When a mistake occurs, the goal is **repair**, not punishment.

Rather than blaming, attacking, or going for an eye for an eye—if the person who made a mistake wants to make up for it, **allow them to make it right.**

## How to Make It Right

1. **Take responsibility and ownership** of what occurred
2. **Apologize with action**, not just words

### Apologizing with Action

"I'm sorry" is not enough if it leaves the other person still hurt.

Making it right means:
- Asking what they need
- Taking concrete steps
- Following through

## When the Other Person Doesn't Want Contact

Sometimes the person receiving the repair may:
- Not want communication at all
- Want less than you want to give
- Need space more than words

**Respecting their wishes IS the action.**

Even if it doesn't feel satisfying because you wanted to give more—honoring their boundary is the repair.

## Allowing Repair

If you're the one who was harmed:

- Can you allow the person to make it right?
- Or are you more invested in punishment?
- What would actually help you heal?

Sometimes people want revenge more than repair. That's a choice—but it's not resolution.

## When Repair Isn't Possible

Some harms are too severe. Some people won't take [responsibility](./responsibility.md).

In those cases:
- Match [response to severity](./appropriate-response.md)
- Involve facilitators
- Prioritize your safety
- Don't become a harm-creator yourself
