## Definition

Responsibility means asking:

> **What happened? How did my actions play a part in creating this outcome? What can I do in the future to create something else I want instead?**

## Omni-Responsible

You are responsible for everything in your life that you have the power to influence.

**Key insight:** People can't take responsibility for things they believe they have no control over.

Instead of lecturing someone on morality when they're not taking responsibility:
- Show them their own power
- Show them they can create a different outcome
- Once they see their power, responsibility follows naturally

## The 100% Control Principle

See: [100% Control](../tools/100-percent-control.md)

It takes two to dance. Even when multiple people created an outcome, you often have 100% control over whether that outcome happens.

> If someone invites you to dance, you both have to say yes for the dance to happen. If either says no, it doesn't happen.

This doesn't let others off the hook. It's about recognizing your power to create your own safety.

## Why People Don't Take Responsibility

1. They don't see their power
2. They've been taught they're powerless
3. Trauma has convinced them the world happens TO them
4. Taking responsibility feels like admitting fault (it's not)

## Responsibility ≠ Blame

Taking responsibility is not the same as accepting blame.

- **Blame** = You caused this, you're bad
- **Responsibility** = I had power here, I can use it differently
