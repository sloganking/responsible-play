## How to Use

Ask two questions:

1. **Did they mean to do it?** (Intentional vs Unintentional)
2. **Were they thinking?** (Conscious vs Unconscious)

The answer tells you what kind of response is needed.

## Quick Reference Table

| Type | They meant it? | They were thinking? | Response |
|------|----------------|---------------------|----------|
| Malicious | Yes | Yes | Accountability |
| Wrong Thinking | No | Yes | Education |
| Accident | No | No | Awareness |

## Note on Fawning

Fawning doesn't fit cleanly in this matrix—it's a trauma response that creates [two victims](./fawning-diagram.md).
