# Content Preservation Rules

## NEVER Delete Without Permission

When moving, refactoring, or reorganizing content:

1. **Quotes are sacred.** Any blockquote with attribution (`> "..." — *Author*`) must be preserved. NEVER remove quotes during refactoring unless explicitly told to delete them.

2. **Show before deleting.** If a refactor would remove content, LIST what would be removed and get explicit approval before proceeding.

3. **Moving ≠ Deleting.** When asked to "move content from A to B," this means COPY to B, then remove from A. Verify nothing was lost.

4. **Attributions matter.** Logan wants credit on his quotes. Never remove `— *Logan King👑*` or any other attribution.

## Red Flags to Watch For

- Refactoring that shortens content significantly
- Moving content between files
- "Cleaning up" or "simplifying" sections
- Any operation on blockquotes

## When in Doubt

Ask: "This refactor would remove [X]. Should I preserve it or is it okay to delete?"

## Examples

❌ BAD: Moving a section and silently dropping a quote
❌ BAD: Removing attribution when copying a quote
❌ BAD: "Simplifying" by cutting valuable examples

✅ GOOD: "I'm moving this section. It contains 2 quotes — I'll preserve both."
✅ GOOD: "This refactor would remove the Kellogg example. Keep it or delete?"
✅ GOOD: Copying content fully, then confirming nothing was lost
