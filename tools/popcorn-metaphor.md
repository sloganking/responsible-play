# The Popcorn Metaphor

## The Teaching Tool

Start with a question:

> **Raise your hand if you've ever burned popcorn in the microwave.**

Almost everyone has.

## The Follow-Up

> When you burned the popcorn, was it because you **wanted** to burn it?

No. It was because you weren't thinking.

Even though you've cooked popcorn successfully a thousand times, due to being sleepy or careless or something in between—you had an accident out of unconsciousness.

## The Bridge

People do this all the time, in every field.

This happens in sacred sexuality temples and play parties too.

**The difference:**

When you burn popcorn, people understand. "Oh, you weren't paying attention."

When an accident happens at a play party, our culture has so much trauma and sensitivity around sexuality that the mistake is often not seen kindly.

## What Happens

People may:
- Project and assume you were **consciously malicious** when you were not
- Treat you and attack you as such
- Treat the [severity](../concepts/severity.md) of your mistake as HIGH even though it was MEDIUM

## The Point

Accidents happen. Even to good people. Even to experienced people.

The question is:
- Was it an accident or was it [malicious](../concepts/types-of-mistakes.md)?
- What is the actual [severity](../concepts/severity.md)?
- Is the [response appropriate](../concepts/appropriate-response.md)?

## For Facilitators

> My position, if mistakes happen in the container, is for you to tell us, the facilitators.

We can help assess what actually happened and guide the repair process.
