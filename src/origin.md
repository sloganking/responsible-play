# The Rescue That Broke Me

---

When I was a kid, my dad spanked me. A lot.

My interpretation at the time: I was doing my homework too slow. He thought I was trying to get out of it, or being oppositionally defiant, or throwing a fit. Whatever he saw, it wasn't what I was experiencing.

What I was experiencing: trying my best. And it not being enough. And being beaten anyway.

I tried to communicate. I tried to say I was doing my best. He didn't hear it. He was certain he knew what was happening—and he was wrong.

## His Story

Years later, my father and I talked about it. He sees it differently now.

He was in [Rescuer](./concepts/drama-triangle.md) mode. He was afraid for me. He saw a son who couldn't handle pressure, who would crumble when the world didn't bend to his needs. And the world doesn't bend. He knew that. He'd lived it.

So he tried to toughen me up. Prepare me. Make me strong enough to survive what was coming.

His intentions were love. His methods were violence. And the outcome was the opposite of what he wanted.

He probably made it _harder_ for me to perform under pressure—not easier. The beatings didn't teach me resilience. They taught me that trying my best wasn't safe. That I couldn't trust my own experience. That the people who loved me could hurt me while believing they were helping.

## What It Did to Me

I felt small. Helpless. Terrified of a world that seemed designed to crush me.

I developed a victim mentality. Everything happened _to_ me. I had no power. I couldn't protect myself, couldn't change my circumstances, couldn't do anything but endure.

That mindset ran my life for years. And then, at 25, it culminated.

Multiple traumas I'd never processed came up at once. I developed PTSD. I had eight-hour panic attacks every other day. I felt like a helpless slave—broken by my past, unable to get the connection and intimacy I desperately wanted, terrified of rejection. I was resentful. I was borderline suicidal.

I was stuck in the [Victim](./concepts/drama-triangle.md) position. And I didn't even know there was another option.

## Waking Up

Eventually, I was in so much pain that I made a decision: I would do _anything_ to change.

That's when things started shifting. I did therapy—five hours a week for a year. I dove into personal development: Landmark Forum, Tony Robbins, anything that promised transformation. I learned the language that separates story from reality. I started seeing how much of what I believed was just... belief.

But the biggest shift came from somewhere unexpected: play parties.

My first one was the most exciting and terrifying thing I'd ever done. I was so sensitive to rejection—especially around sexuality—that the smallest sign of it could send me into an eight-hour panic attack. But I went anyway. Because I'd decided I would do anything.

And I kept going.

Sometimes someone would say no, and my body would spiral. Dissociation. Panic. The whole physiological storm. But afterward, I could analyze what happened. I could see that the rejection wasn't death. That my stories about being powerless with women and sex weren't true. That my body was reacting to ghosts.

The more I was there, the more my body relaxed. I gained control over my actions. I discovered I had a [fawning](./concepts/fawning.md) pattern—from being afraid of my father growing up, I'd developed a pleasing reflex. My body did things automatically that I really didn't want it to do. Seeing that was the first step to changing it.

I met people. Lots of people. I built relationships. I learned how humans actually work—not from studying them at a distance, but from being in the mess with them. I saw all the different ways people think, react, protect themselves, hurt each other, love each other.

Eventually, at a retreat, I saw the same pattern play out that had shaped my childhood. Someone, through distorted beliefs, thought they were protecting someone—but all they were really doing was deeply harming someone else. It was my father and me, replayed in a different context. And in that moment, something crystallized.

I saw how much we need clear eyes in this area. Sexuality, intimacy, connection—this is where our culture carries the most distortion, the most unprocessed fear, the most potential for harm done in the name of protection.

I wasn't small. I wasn't helpless. The story that said I was—the story I'd believed for years—was just a story. It felt like truth. It wasn't.

When I saw that, everything changed.

I started taking [responsibility](./concepts/responsibility.md). Not blame—responsibility. I started seeing where I had control. I started making choices instead of just reacting. I started building a life instead of just surviving one.

## Why This Matters

Here's what that journey taught me:

**Most harm comes from love.**

My father wasn't a monster. He wasn't a predator. He was a scared parent who loved his son and believed—with absolute certainty—that he knew what that son needed. His certainty was wrong. His love was real. The harm was real too.

This is the [Rescuer](./concepts/why-rescuers-are-dangerous.md) pattern. Good people, harmful beliefs, devastating outcomes. Not despite the love—because of the certainty that comes with it.

**Victim mentality is a prison.**

I know what it feels like to believe you're powerless. I lived there for decades. It's not a moral failing—it's a trap. And you can't see out of it while you're in it. The bars are invisible.

That's why I empathize with people stuck in that mindset. I was them. I believed what they believe. And I know it's possible to wake up—because I did.

**Responsibility is freedom.**

The moment you see your power, everything changes. Not because the world gets easier—but because you're no longer a passenger in your own life.

## Why I Wrote This

I'm here because I've been on all sides.

I've been harmed by a Rescuer who loved me. I've lived in the victim dream. And I've come close to becoming the harm myself.

In my years of resentment and victimhood, I felt the pull toward perpetrator. My relationships were dysfunctional. I carried bitterness toward my father and others who didn't deserve it—or at least didn't deserve the intensity of what I felt. I caused people stress. I was a drain when I could have been a gift.

I know what it's like to be so trapped in your own pain that you start hurting the people around you without even seeing it. I've felt the gravity that pulls Victim toward Persecutor.

I'm not lecturing from above. I'm not claiming to have it all figured out. I'm someone who suffered for a long time, caused suffering to others, found a way out, and wants to help others find it too.

That's why I care about belief. About responsibility. About helping people see their power instead of reinforcing their helplessness.

That's why I wrote this book.

**Waking people up from the dream that they're small—that's what I'm here for.**
