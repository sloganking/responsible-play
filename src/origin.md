# The Rescue That Broke Me

---

When I was a kid, my dad spanked me. A lot.

My interpretation at the time: I was doing my homework too slow. He thought I was trying to get out of it, or being oppositionally defiant, or throwing a fit. Whatever he saw, it wasn't what I was experiencing.

What I was experiencing: trying my best. And it not being enough. And being beaten anyway.

I tried to communicate. I tried to say I was doing my best. He didn't hear it. He was certain he knew what was happening—and he was wrong.

## His Story

Years later, my father and I talked about it. He sees it differently now.

He was in [Rescuer](./concepts/drama-triangle.md) mode. He was afraid for me. He saw a son who couldn't handle pressure, who would crumble when the world didn't bend to his needs. And the world doesn't bend. He knew that. He'd lived it.

So he tried to toughen me up. Prepare me. Make me strong enough to survive what was coming.

His intentions were love. His methods were violence. And the outcome was the opposite of what he wanted.

He probably made it _harder_ for me to perform under pressure—not easier. The beatings didn't teach me resilience. They taught me that trying my best wasn't safe. That I couldn't trust my own experience. That the people who loved me could hurt me while believing they were helping.

## What It Did to Me

I felt small. Helpless. Terrified of a world that seemed designed to crush me.

I developed a victim mentality. Everything happened _to_ me. I had no power. I couldn't protect myself, couldn't change my circumstances, couldn't do anything but endure.

That mindset ran my life for decades. It was hell. Not dramatic, movie-scene hell—just a low, grinding misery where nothing ever got better because I didn't believe I could make it better.

I was stuck in the [Victim](./concepts/drama-triangle.md) position. And I didn't even know there was another option.

## Waking Up

I don't remember the exact moment it shifted. It wasn't one conversation or one book. It was a slow accumulation—of experiences, of people who saw more in me than I saw in myself, of moments where I accidentally discovered I had power I didn't know I had.

Eventually, I saw through the dream.

I wasn't small. I wasn't helpless. The story that said I was—the story I'd believed for decades—was just a story. It felt like truth. It wasn't.

When I saw that, everything changed.

I started taking [responsibility](./concepts/responsibility.md). Not blame—responsibility. I started seeing where I had control. I started making choices instead of just reacting. I started building a life instead of just surviving one.

## Why This Matters

Here's what that journey taught me:

**Most harm comes from love.**

My father wasn't a monster. He wasn't a predator. He was a scared parent who loved his son and believed—with absolute certainty—that he knew what that son needed. His certainty was wrong. His love was real. The harm was real too.

This is the [Rescuer](./concepts/why-rescuers-are-dangerous.md) pattern. Good people, harmful beliefs, devastating outcomes. Not despite the love—because of the certainty that comes with it.

**Victim mentality is a prison.**

I know what it feels like to believe you're powerless. I lived there for decades. It's not a moral failing—it's a trap. And you can't see out of it while you're in it. The bars are invisible.

That's why I empathize with people stuck in that mindset. I was them. I believed what they believe. And I know it's possible to wake up—because I did.

**Responsibility is freedom.**

The moment you see your power, everything changes. Not because the world gets easier—but because you're no longer a passenger in your own life.

## Why I Wrote This

I'm here because I've been on both sides.

I've been harmed by a Rescuer who loved me. I've lived in the victim dream. I've crawled out. I've learned to see through the stories—my own and others'.

I'm not lecturing from above. I'm not claiming to have it all figured out. I'm someone who suffered for a long time, found a way out, and wants to help others find it too.

That's why I care about belief. About responsibility. About helping people see their power instead of reinforcing their helplessness.

That's why I wrote this book.

**Waking people up from the dream that they're small—that's what I'm here for.**
