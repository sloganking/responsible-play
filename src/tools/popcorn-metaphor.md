# The Popcorn Metaphor

## The Setup

Have you ever burned popcorn in the microwave?

Almost everyone has.

Now: when you burned it, was it because you *wanted* to burn it?

No. It was because you weren't thinking.

Even though you've cooked popcorn successfully a thousand times, due to being sleepy or careless or something in between—you had an accident out of unconsciousness.

## The Bridge

People do this all the time, in every field.

This happens in sacred sexuality temples and play parties too.

**The difference:**

When you burn popcorn, people understand. "Oh, you weren't paying attention. Obviously a mistake."

When you cross a boundary for one second at a play party before catching yourself? "Oh my god, did you do that on purpose? Are you a predator?" Our culture has so much trauma and sensitivity around sexuality that the same kind of mistake—a moment of unconsciousness—gets treated as intentional malice.

## What Happens

People may:

- Project and assume you were **consciously malicious** when you were not
- Treat you and attack you as such
- Treat the [severity](../concepts/severity.md) of your mistake as HIGH even though it was MEDIUM

## The Point

Accidents happen. Even to experienced people. Even to the best of us.

The question is:

- Was it an accident or was it [malicious](../concepts/types-of-mistakes.md)?
- What is the actual [severity](../concepts/severity.md)?
- Is the [response appropriate](../concepts/appropriate-response.md)?

## Film Example: The Iron Giant

[📽️ Watch the clip](https://youtu.be/BPvtRdOMzeg?si=cPGZR206wnRQft71)

In this scene, Hogarth pulls out a toy gun. The Iron Giant's automatic defense programming kicks in—lasers fire from his eyes before he can stop himself. He almost kills the child he loves.

This is a perfect example of:

- **High severity** — could have caused permanent harm
- **Unconscious** — not a choice, automatic programming
- **Not malicious** — the Giant would never choose to hurt Hogarth

The Giant didn't want to do it. He wasn't thinking. His programming—like trauma, like a reflex—took over before his conscious mind could intervene.

This is what happens when people make mistakes out of unconsciousness. They're not bad. They're not malicious. Something automatic fired that they didn't choose.

The Iron Giant is pure goodness—but lacks wisdom about his own nature. He doesn't know what will trigger his programming. That's why goodness alone isn't enough. (See: ["Goodness without wisdom always accomplishes evil"](../concepts/i-made-a-mistake.md#why-mistakes-are-necessary))
