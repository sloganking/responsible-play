# The Popcorn Metaphor

## The Setup

Have you ever burned popcorn in the microwave?

Almost everyone has.

Now: when you burned it, was it because you *wanted* to burn it?

No. It was because you weren't thinking.

Even though you've cooked popcorn successfully a thousand times, due to being sleepy or careless or something in between—you had an accident out of unconsciousness.

## The Bridge

People do this all the time, in every field.

This happens in sacred sexuality temples and play parties too.

**The difference:**

When you burn popcorn, people understand. "Oh, you weren't paying attention. Obviously a mistake."

When you cross a boundary for one second at a play party before catching yourself? "Oh my god, did you do that on purpose? Are you a predator?" Our culture has so much trauma and sensitivity around sexuality that the same kind of mistake—a moment of unconsciousness—gets treated as intentional malice.

## What Happens

People may:

- Project and assume you were **consciously malicious** when you were not
- Treat you and attack you as such
- Treat the [severity](../concepts/severity.md) of your mistake as HIGH even though it was MEDIUM

## The Point

Accidents happen. Even to experienced people. Even to the best of us.

The question is:

- Was it an accident or was it [malicious](../concepts/types-of-mistakes.md)?
- What is the actual [severity](../concepts/severity.md)?
- Is the [response appropriate](../concepts/appropriate-response.md)?
