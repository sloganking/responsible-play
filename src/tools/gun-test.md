# The Gun Test

> **If you wouldn't wield a weapon, should you be wielding a person?**

## The Self-Check

Before engaging in play or intimacy, ask yourself:

> **In my current state, would I feel comfortable and responsible wielding a gun?**

This isn't about guns. It's about honestly assessing whether you're in a fit state to handle activities that could cause harm if you're not fully present.

## If the Answer Is No

Ask: **Why not?**

What's making you feel like you wouldn't trust yourself with a gun right now?

Examples:

- "I took sleeping medication and I'm tired"
- "I've been drinking"
- "I'm emotionally activated right now"
- "My mind isn't clear"
- "I'm distracted / not fully present"
- "I'm in a weird headspace"

## Then Ask

> **Should those same reasons stop me from playing at my current level of severity?**

### Severity Levels

| Activity                          | Severity |
| --------------------------------- | -------- |
| Holding a gun                     | HIGH     |
| Touching/intimacy at a play party | MEDIUM   |
| Conversation                      | LOW      |

### The Logic

If you wouldn't trust yourself with a gun because you're tired, impaired, or emotionally activated...

Should you trust yourself with MEDIUM-severity activities in that state?

The same things that would make you dangerous with a gun—impaired judgment, slow reactions, lack of presence—can make you dangerous in intimate situations too. Not gun-dangerous, but capable of causing harm you wouldn't cause if you were fully present.

## Example

> "I'm on sleeping medication and tired. Would I trust myself with a gun right now? No—my reactions are slow and my judgment is off.
>
> Should I be touching people and engaging in intimacy? Probably not. The same impairment that makes a gun risky makes play risky. I might miss cues, cross boundaries I'd normally catch, or make mistakes I wouldn't make sober and rested."
>
> → Politely disengage. Come back when you're in a better state.

## When to Use This

- Before entering a play space
- When you notice you're "off" but tempted to engage anyway
- When you've been drinking or using substances
- When you're emotionally activated
- When someone invites you to play and you're not sure you're ready

## Beyond Tonight

The Gun Test is a tool you use while still conscious to help you avoid impairment-caused unconscious mistakes.

However, there are other tools you can use to reduce harm—even if you accidentally enter an unconscious state. For the full picture of preventing unconscious mistakes, see: [Why Unconscious Mistakes Happen](../concepts/types-of-mistakes.md#why-unconscious-mistakes-happen).

---

## The Point

You wouldn't hand a gun to someone who's impaired. Don't hand your body—or access to someone else's—to an impaired version of yourself.

**Self-check is [taking responsibility](../concepts/responsibility.md).**
