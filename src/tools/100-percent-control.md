# 100% Control

## The Concept

It takes two to dance.

When something you don't want occurs while interacting with another person, multiple people played a part in creating that outcome.

**However:** The majority of the time, you have the power to control 100% of the outcome.

## The Dance Metaphor

> If somebody invites you to dance, you both have to say yes in order for the dance to happen.
>
> If either of you say no, the dance doesn't happen.

**That's what 100% control means.**

You don't have just part of the power. Oftentimes, you have ALL the power to create the reality you want.

### Both People Have 100% Control

Here's the key distinction: you have 100% control over whether you dance. And so does the other person. Both of you, simultaneously, have 100% control over whether the dance happens.

This isn't a contradiction. It's not zero-sum. You're not dividing 100% between you. You each have 100% control over *your* part—and since either of you saying no stops the dance, you each have 100% power to prevent the outcome.

When something goes wrong, multiple people created it. You had 100% control. They had 100% control. Both are true. Both can take full responsibility without diminishing the other's.

### "But What If They Say No?"

Someone might hear this and think: "I *don't* have 100% control. If I ask someone to dance and they say no, I can't dance. So I'm at their mercy."

Not quite. You have 100% control over *whether* you dance. You don't have 100% control over *who* you dance with.

If you want to dance and one person says no, you ask someone else. And someone else. Eventually, someone says yes. The dance happens—just not with the specific person you first imagined.

**You can have anything you want. You just can't have it with whoever you want.**

This applies far beyond dancing. You can have connection, intimacy, love, adventure—you just can't force a specific person to be the one you have it with. When people feel powerless, it's often because they've confused "I can't have this with *them*" with "I can't have this at all." Those are very different statements. The first might be true. The second almost never is.

### "But What If Nobody Will Dance?"

Go a level up.

If the only three dancers in your village all said no, you're not stuck. You can travel to a place where there are more dancers. You can move there permanently if dancing matters enough to you. Or you can stay where you are and *create* dancers—start a dance school, make dancing look fun, inspire people who never considered it.

This is the difference between a [Victim and a Creator](../concepts/drama-triangle.md). The Victim stops at the first "no" and concludes: *I can't dance. It's not possible for me.* The Creator steps back, looks at the bigger picture, and asks: *How else could I make this happen?*

People stop too soon. They stop at "she said no" and conclude they can't have connection. They stop at "the school rejected me" and conclude they can't have education. They stop at "there are no events in my city" and conclude they can't have this experience. Each of these has a solution one level up—but you have to be willing to look for it.

**You're never actually stuck. You just stopped looking for solutions too soon.**

The prestigious school in town said no? Apply to ten others. Move cities. Build the skills that make you undeniable. Create your own program. The path you *imagined* was blocked. The path *itself* was never blocked—you just hadn't looked for it yet.

This is what 100% control actually means in practice. Not that every door opens for you. But that there's always another door—and finding it is your responsibility and your power.

### Why People Miss This

When someone feels like a victim and doesn't see their power, they often correctly see that the other person had 100% control. But they fail to see that *they* also had 100% control—or something close to it.

They think it's 100% vs 0%. It's actually 100% vs 100%.

Because they don't see their own part, they put all the blame on the other person. The other person becomes the sole creator of the outcome. This is why victimhood feels so certain—they're not wrong that the other person had power. They're just blind to their own.

## What This Is NOT

This does **not** abdicate other participants from [responsibility](../concepts/responsibility.md).

Everyone, via action or inaction, created what happened.

This is just a way of recognizing YOUR power:

- Showing you how you can create what you want
- Even in the face of actors who have other goals
- Even when others want different things
- It's showing you how you can create your own safety

## Why This Matters

When people don't see their power:

- They don't take responsibility
- They feel like victims of circumstance
- They wait for others to change
- They stay stuck

When people see their 100% control:

- They recognize their choices
- They can create different outcomes
- They stop waiting for the world to be different
- They become empowered

## Teaching This

This is about empowerment, not blame.

You're not saying "it's your fault."

You're saying: **"You have more power than you realized. Let's look at how you can use it."**
