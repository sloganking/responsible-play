## How Feelings Actually Work

Most people believe their feelings are caused by what happens to them.

**This is false.**

Your feelings are caused by the **stories you tell yourself** about what happened.

└─────────────────┘      └─────────────────┘      └─────────────────┘
```

This concept comes from _Crucial Conversations_ and transforms how you understand emotional reactions—yours and others'.

### The Same Experience, Different Feelings

Consider death.

In our culture, death is treated as inherently tragic. We assume grief is the natural, unavoidable response to losing someone.

But in other cultures:

- Death is **joyous**—a celebration of the person's transition
- Death is **neutral**—just part of the cycle
- Children hold the severed limbs of deceased grandparents without distress

Same experience. Completely different feelings.

The difference isn't the death. It's the **story** about what death means.

### Any Feeling to Any Stimulus

This means something profound:

> **Humans can feel any emotion in response to any experience—because we can have any story in our heads.**

Someone touches you without asking:

- Story: "They're a predator testing my boundaries" → Fear, violation
- Story: "They're socially awkward and didn't know better" → Mild annoyance
- Story: "They felt connected to me and got carried away" → Compassion, maybe flattery

Same touch. Same person. Completely different emotional experiences—based entirely on the story.

### The Story Happens Instantly

Here's the tricky part: **you don't notice the story.**

The experience happens. The feeling arrives. It seems like the experience _caused_ the feeling directly.

But there was a story in between. It happened so fast you didn't see it.

This is why two people can witness the exact same event and have completely opposite emotional reactions. They're not reacting to the event—they're reacting to their stories about the event.

## What Trauma Actually Is

Trauma is a **story stored in the body.**

It's not just a memory. It's a meaning-making pattern that runs automatically, below conscious awareness, telling you:

> "You are in danger. This is an emergency. Take action NOW."

When something in the present resembles something from the past—even vaguely—the trauma pattern activates. The body floods with stress hormones. The thinking brain goes offline. And one of four automatic responses takes over:

### The Four Trauma Responses

| Response   | What It Looks Like                       | The Story Running                 |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Fight**  | Aggression, pushing back, attacking      | "I must destroy the threat"       |
| **Flight** | Leaving, avoiding, running away          | "I must escape the threat"        |
| **Freeze** | Going still, shutting down, dissociating | "If I don't move, maybe it stops" |
| **Fawn**   | People-pleasing, agreeing, appeasing     | "If I make them happy, I'm safe"  |

None of these are conscious choices. They're automatic programs running from old stories.

### The Problem: Old Stories, New Situations

Trauma responses were adaptive once. They helped you survive something.

The problem is they keep running **even when the danger is gone.**

Someone makes an innocent mistake, and your body screams "PREDATOR!" Someone asks you a question, and you freeze. Someone expresses disappointment, and you fawn to make it okay.

The experience is new. But you're reacting to an old story.

### How Subtle Stories Create Real Problems

Here's what makes this tricky: **you might not even know your story exists.**

You can do years of healing work and still have a subtle lens you've never examined—a background hum of meaning-making that's so normal to you that you don't recognize it as a filter.

**Example: The "I'm Being Left Out" Lens**

Imagine someone with a deep, unexamined story: "I'm always being excluded."

They might not consciously think this. But their perception is subtly biased toward seeing exclusion everywhere:

- When two people whisper, they assume it's about them
- When someone gets attention they don't, they feel passed over
- When ambiguous situations arise, they interpret them as "everyone else is getting something I'm not"

Now put this person in a play space. They're tired. Their thinking brain is offline. And something ambiguous happens—maybe they see movement that could be interpreted multiple ways.

Their "exclusion" filter kicks in automatically:

> "They're doing something I'm not included in."

And from that interpretation—which may or may not be accurate—they take an action. An action they might not have taken if they'd seen the situation clearly.

**The mistake wasn't malicious.** They weren't trying to harm anyone. But their unconscious story distorted their perception, and their perception drove their behavior.

### Why This Matters

This is **exceedingly subtle.**

You don't normally think: "My tendency to feel excluded is affecting my actions right now." You just... see what you see. And act on what you see.

But what you see is filtered through stories you may have never examined.

In play spaces, where:

- Stakes are high
- Bodies are involved
- Consent depends on accurate perception
- You might be tired, altered, or emotionally activated

...these subtle filters can create real problems.

### Stories and the Problems They Create

| The Story                            | How It Distorts Perception                                                                         | The Mistake It Can Cause                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "I'm always being left out"          | Sees exclusion everywhere; interprets ambiguous situations as "they're doing something without me" | Misreads what's happening, acts on false interpretation, creates boundary violations from confusion            |
| "Everyone wants what we have"        | Paranoid about partner; assumes every friendly interaction is someone trying to steal them         | Accuses innocent people of predatory behavior, creates conflict, drives partner away with jealousy             |
| "People always take advantage of me" | Sees manipulation in normal requests; assumes the worst intent                                     | Over-reacts to low-severity situations, shuts down connection, may launch [witch hunts](./before-you-judge.md) |
| "I'm not worthy of attention"        | Assumes rejection is coming; doesn't believe genuine interest                                      | [Fawns](./fawning.md) instead of setting boundaries, says yes when they mean no, gets hurt                     |
| "Men only want one thing"            | Interprets every touch as sexual; sees predatory intent in friendliness                            | Accuses someone of being "rapey" when they were just being warm, destroys reputations over nothing             |
| "I have to earn my place"            | Feels like they don't belong unless they're useful or pleasing                                     | Over-gives, burns out, resents others, [fawns](./fawning.md) to stay accepted                                  |

**Example: "Everyone Wants What We Have"**

A couple comes to a play party together. One partner has an unexamined story: "Everyone wants what we have. People are always trying to take what's mine."

At the party, someone chats warmly with their partner. Just friendly conversation—nothing flirtatious.

But through the jealousy filter:

> "They're trying to steal my partner. I need to intervene."

They pull their partner away, act cold to the "threat," maybe even confront them later. The other person is confused and hurt—they were just being friendly.

The jealous partner might even go further: warning others that this person is "predatory," starting whispers, creating [high-severity](./severity.md) consequences for someone who did nothing wrong.

All from a story they didn't even know they had.

**Example: "I'm Always Being Left Out"**

Someone with this story attends a group experience. They're tired. Something ambiguous happens—maybe they see movement they can't quite interpret, or they notice others connecting in ways they're not part of.

Their filter activates:

> "Everyone else is getting something. I'm being excluded again."

From that interpretation—which may be completely wrong—they take an action. Maybe they push into something they weren't invited to. Maybe they make an assumption about what's allowed based on what they thought they saw.

The mistake wasn't malicious. But the unconscious story distorted their perception, and their tired brain acted on the distortion.

### The Invitation

This isn't about being paranoid about your every perception.

It's about humility:

> "I might have stories I don't know about. My interpretation might not be accurate. Before I act—especially on something significant—let me check."

This is why [Notice, Feel, Story](../tools/notice-feel-story.md) and [Before You Judge](./before-you-judge.md) matter so much. They're tools for catching your filters before they cause harm.

## The Problem in Sex-Positive Spaces

When a boundary violation occurs, what do you assume about the person who made it?

- Do you assume the best or the worst?
- What meaning do you ascribe to mistakes?
- Do you know you have trauma that causes your interpretations to lean a certain way?

### How Trauma Distorts Everything

Trauma creates subconscious filters. You may not even know you have trauma. It may just be one of those filters you view the world through.

**A belief and narrative about the world and what happened to you.**

Whatever comes up—whatever mistake someone makes, you make it, they make it—you're going to view everything through your beliefs and filters, **which are not necessarily real.**

Someone's hand brushes your thigh:

- Without trauma filter: "That was probably accidental. I'll mention my boundary if it happens again."
- With trauma filter: "They're testing me. This is how it starts. I need to protect myself."

Both interpretations create very different [appropriate responses](./appropriate-response.md).

One leads to a simple conversation. The other might lead to accusations, witch hunts, or [high-severity](./severity.md) responses to a low-severity mistake.

## Limiting Beliefs & Primary Questions

(Concept from Tony Robbins' Date with Destiny)

There may be a single sentence running your life and tainting how you see everything in the world.

Examples:

- "People always hurt me"
- "I'm not safe"
- "Men/women can't be trusted"
- "I have to protect myself at all costs"
- "If I let my guard down, I'll be taken advantage of"
- "People only want one thing from me"

These aren't conscious beliefs you chose. They were installed by experiences—often in childhood—and they run automatically.

These filters will distort:

- How you interpret others' [types of mistakes](./types-of-mistakes.md)
- How you assess [severity](./severity.md)
- Whether your [response is appropriate](./appropriate-response.md)
- Whether you see someone as a predator or a person who made a mistake

## Checking Your Stories

The good news: once you understand that feelings come from stories, you can **check your stories.**

Before you react, pause and ask:

1. **What happened?** (Just the facts—what a camera would have recorded)
2. **What story am I telling myself about it?**
3. **Is that story definitely true, or is it an assumption?**
4. **What other stories could explain what happened?**

This is the core of the [Notice, Feel, Story](../tools/notice-feel-story.md) tool—a practical technique for separating experience from interpretation.

### Example

**Experience:** He touched my lower back without asking.

**My story:** He's testing my boundaries to see what he can get away with. This is predatory behavior.

**Possible alternative stories:**

- He's affectionate and thought we had a connection
- In his culture, that touch is normal and friendly
- He wasn't thinking and did it automatically
- He genuinely didn't know I'd mind

**What would help:** Asking him directly. Using [Notice, Feel, Story](../tools/notice-feel-story.md) to check instead of assuming.

## Responsibility When You Have Trauma

Having trauma is **not your fault.**

How you handle it when interacting with others **is your responsibility.**

This isn't blame. It's [empowerment](./responsibility.md). You're the only one who can:

- Know your triggers
- Communicate them when possible
- Pause before reacting
- Ask: "Is this about NOW or about THEN?"
- Check your stories before acting on them
- Take [100% control](../tools/100-percent-control.md) of your safety

### The Hard Truth

Your trauma responses can harm others.

If your body screams "PREDATOR!" and you act on that—spreading warnings, starting witch hunts, destroying someone's reputation—you may be creating [high-severity](./severity.md) harm to someone who made an innocent mistake.

Your fear felt real. Your story felt true. But the consequences you created are still your responsibility.

This isn't fair. You didn't ask for trauma. But the people you harm didn't ask for your trauma responses either.

### The Path Forward

Healing isn't about suppressing your responses. It's about:

1. **Recognizing** when you're reacting to old stories
2. **Pausing** before taking action
3. **Checking** your story with the people involved
4. **Choosing** your response consciously instead of automatically

Over time, with practice and often with support, the old stories lose their grip. The gap between trigger and response grows longer. You gain the ability to feel the fear without acting from it.

This is what it means to take responsibility for your trauma while also having compassion for yourself.
