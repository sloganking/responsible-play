## How Feelings Actually Work

Most people believe their feelings are caused by what happens to them.

**This is false.**

Your feelings are caused by the **stories you tell yourself** about what happened.

```

└─────────────────┘      └─────────────────┘      └─────────────────┘
```

This concept comes from _Crucial Conversations_ and transforms how you understand emotional reactions—yours and others'.

### The Same Experience, Different Feelings

Consider death.

In our culture, death is treated as inherently tragic. We assume grief is the natural, unavoidable response to losing someone.

But in other cultures:

- Death is **joyous**—a celebration of the person's transition
- Death is **neutral**—just part of the cycle
- Children hold the severed limbs of deceased grandparents without distress

Same experience. Completely different feelings.

The difference isn't the death. It's the **story** about what death means.

### Any Feeling to Any Stimulus

This means something profound:

> **Humans can feel any emotion in response to any experience—because we can have any story in our heads.**

Someone touches you without asking:

- Story: "They're a predator testing my boundaries" → Fear, violation
- Story: "They're socially awkward and didn't know better" → Mild annoyance
- Story: "They felt connected to me and got carried away" → Compassion, maybe flattery

Same touch. Same person. Completely different emotional experiences—based entirely on the story.

### Why Knowing Doesn't Change Feeling

You might be thinking: "Okay, I understand intellectually that my feelings come from stories. So why can't I just change the story and feel differently?"

Here's the thing: **stories don't live in your intellect. They live in your body.**

They're stored in your subconscious, ingrained in your neurons, wired into automatic responses you didn't consciously choose. You can understand something intellectually and still feel the old way—because the story isn't running in the part of your brain that does understanding.

This is why you can't just think your way out of emotional patterns. The stories are so deep they're automatic. Often, you're not even aware when they're affecting you. You just feel the feeling and assume it's the natural response to reality.

**But here's the good news: it is possible to change.**

It takes time. It takes exposure to the situations where your old story gets activated—and consciously noticing that the story isn't true. It takes new data, new experiences that contradict the old pattern. It takes deliberate effort to construct a different story and reinforce it until it becomes the new automatic.

This is what healing looks like. Not flipping a switch, but gradually rewiring the deep patterns until your body tells a different story than it used to.

### The Story Happens Instantly

Here's the tricky part: **you don't notice the story.**

The experience happens. The feeling arrives. It seems like the experience _caused_ the feeling directly.

But there was a story in between. It happened so fast you didn't see it.

This is why two people can witness the exact same event and have completely opposite emotional reactions. They're not reacting to the event—they're reacting to their stories about the event.

## Stories Control Attention

Here's another layer: **stories don't just create feelings. They also direct attention.**

> **"We don't experience life. We experience the life we focus on."**  
> — Tony Robbins

Where you look determines what you see. And what you see determines the story you tell. And the story you tell determines how you feel.

### The Brown/Red Exercise

Here's an exercise that makes this visceral:

Look around the room for 10 seconds and count how many **brown** things you see. Go. Brown, brown, brown... count them all.

Done? Good. You have a number. You can probably remember most of the brown things you saw.

Now: **How many red things did you see?**

You don't know. You can't remember them. They all reached your eyeballs—you _saw_ them—but you weren't paying attention to red. So they didn't register.

This is your **reticular activating system (RAS)**—a network in your brainstem that filters what you notice based on what you're looking for. Everything else fades into the background.

**This is different from attention.**

With attention, you perceive many things, and your conscious mind picks which to focus on. You could choose differently.

With your RAS, things are filtered out _before they reach your conscious awareness_. You're not choosing to ignore them—you're literally blind to them. They never made it to the part of your brain that could choose.

In the brown-red exercise, you can consciously shift your attention to red—because someone told you what you were filtering for. You know you were looking for brown, so you can choose to look for red instead.

In real life, nobody prompts you. You don't realize you're scanning for predators. It never occurs to you to scan for friends. The filter runs without you knowing it exists.

From your perspective, you're not filtering at all. You're just looking at the world and seeing what's there. It feels accurate. It feels real. You have no experience of bias—just perception.

Even when you learn that you _have_ an RAS, you still don't know what it's filtering for. You don't know what it makes you see or what it makes you blind to. Figuring that out requires working backwards—noticing patterns like "I tend to see threats more often than other people do" or "I keep finding myself in the same dynamics." Your RAS can filter for multiple things at once, and you're never going to be fully aware of all of them.

That's why RAS-level distortions are so hard to overcome. You can't redirect your attention to possibilities that never reached your conscious mind. You can't consider interpretations that your brainstem already filtered out of existence. You don't even know they were options.

### The Horror Movie Effect

You know how after watching a horror film, you suddenly feel unsafe in your own home?

You're walking to the kitchen at night—something you've done a thousand times—and now every dark corner feels threatening. Every shadow could be a monster. You're looking over your shoulder.

Nothing changed about your house. It's exactly as safe as it's always been. What changed is your RAS. The movie primed you to look for threats. Now that's what your attention is scanning for—and you're finding them everywhere, even when they don't exist.

**This is what happens to people who enter intimate spaces primed for danger.**

If you walk into a temple or play party with your RAS set to "predator detection mode"—looking for threats, expecting harm, scanning for bad actors—you will find them. Every ambiguous touch becomes suspicious. Every awkward moment becomes evidence. Every mistake becomes confirmation.

Not because the threats are real. Because that's what you're looking for.

---

### Don't Watch Horror Before Temple

If you spend five hours consuming content about scary murders, rapists, and consent violations right before you go to a play party—what are you setting yourself up for?

**You're pre-framing yourself to see predators.**

Pre-framing is what happens before you enter a situation that shapes how you'll perceive it. It's the lens you put on before you walk through the door. And whatever lens you're wearing determines what you see.

You're priming your RAS to scan for predators. You're walking into a room full of friends who love and support you, but now you're jumpy and suspicious of everyone. Because you chose to fill your head with monsters right before entering a space full of humans.

This sounds like satire. It sounds unbelievable that someone would need to be told "don't watch horror before you go to the sex party." But that's exactly the level of sensitivity we're operating at. The number of unconscious stories running your perception is immense. If you're consuming predator-hunting content before entering an intimate space, you are setting yourself up to see a bunch of things that aren't real.

This is a clear example of how you affect the probability of your outcomes. You're not _causing_ an assault by watching horror. But you're absolutely affecting how you'll perceive and react to normal touch—and that affects what happens next.

You have [responsibility](./responsibility.md) here. You can choose what you consume before entering a space. You can choose to prime your filter for connection instead of danger.

### When Evidence Gets Through

And when contradictory evidence _does_ get through—when reality is staring you right in the face—your conscious mind will work to protect the belief.

In _The Iron Giant_, there's a character named Kent Mansley who seems completely unreasonable. He looks like a comical villain—both evil and inept. The audience watches him take action after action that makes no sense. He seems to be lying, manipulating, endangering everyone around him for no clear reason.

We never see inside Kent's head—so this is interpretation. But it's grounded in what he actually says. Early in the film, he tells Hogarth about the Russians, about needing to defend the country: "Everyone wants what we have."

That's not just a throwaway line. It's the belief running his entire life.

Once you see that filter, every action he takes suddenly makes sense.

The giant robot must be a weapon—sent by Russians, or aliens, or some enemy government that wants what we have. It can't be friendly. That's not a possibility. It must be harmful.

So when a mother tells Kent her son is alive, safe in the giant's hands, and asks the army to stand down—Kent hears this, and his filter translates it. He turns to the general and reports: "She says the giant killed the boy."

This is one of those moments that makes Kent look purely selfish—or insane. He just lied to a general's face. Why?

But through his filter, this isn't lying. The giant was obviously made by bad actors who want to steal what we have. So of course it killed the child. The mother is probably just hopeful and delusional, wanting to believe her son is alive when he isn't. There's no other possibility. Kent is reporting the truth as his filter sees it.

Later, the giant walks up with the boy visibly alive in its hands. Hogarth—the boy—is shouting: "Don't shoot! Don't shoot!" Plain as day. Everyone can see it. The general calls ceasefire.

Kent screams: "IT'S A TRICK! LAUNCH THE MISSILE!"

His rational mind is working overtime to preserve the belief. _The giant couldn't have NOT killed the boy. Everyone wants what we have, so the giant must be made by an enemy. So the boy must actually be dead. But wait—if they can build a giant metal man, they can probably build holograms. That's it! That's what I'm seeing! Or the boy has been enslaved by the giant and is being forced to tell the army not to shoot, so we let our guard down right before the giant kills all of us!_

The evidence that the giant is friendly and not a threat—is literally standing in front of him. Everyone else can see it. But his filter can't let it in. As a result he orders a nuclear strike on his own position.

This is what foundational beliefs do. When proof against them is standing right in front of you, plain as day for all eyes to see, your rational mind will find a way to make the belief possible anyway. Every explanation it constructs will be logical—given the premise. The premise is never questioned.

Here's the uncomfortable part: if you're watching Kent and thinking "I would never be that blind"—that's the exact filter that makes you Kent. The audience judging him as insane is doing the same thing he's doing: assuming their perception is accurate, assuming they'd see clearly in his position, never questioning the premise.

Everyone has foundational beliefs. Including you. Including me. The question isn't whether you have them. The question is whether you've found them—and whether you've ever watched them override evidence standing right in front of you.

### Before You Enter a Space

Ask yourself honestly:

- **What is my attention primed for?** Am I expecting friends and fun? Or am I expecting predators and danger?
- **What will I see?** If someone makes a mistake, will I see an accident or an attack?
- **What filter am I bringing?** Do I assume people are on my side until proven otherwise? Or do I assume they're threats until proven safe?

If you're entering a space primed to see predators, you're more likely to over-respond to something that isn't actually a threat. [Notice, Feel, Story](../tools/notice-feel-story.md) is critical for you—because your first interpretation will almost certainly be "threat," and you need a way to check whether that's actually true.

### The Blind Men and the Elephant

You've probably heard the parable: several blind men encounter an elephant. One touches the trunk and says "It's a snake." One touches the leg and says "It's a tree." One touches the side and says "It's a wall."

They're all correct about what they observed. They're all wrong about the whole picture. Not because they're stupid or malicious—but because their attention was on different parts of the same thing.

**This is how attention works in conflict.**

Same event. Different attention. Completely different experience of what happened.

### Example: The Fawner's Two Experiences

Consider a [fawning](./fawning.md) situation. The same event occurred—someone said yes when they meant no, then felt violated afterward.

**If the fawner's attention is on:** "Something was done to me that I didn't want"
**They feel:** Violated, victimized, hurt

**If the fawner's attention is on:** "I lied to this person about my consent and then attacked them for believing me"
**They feel:** Guilt, embarrassment, remorse

Same event. Same person. The only difference is where attention went. And that difference creates completely opposite emotional experiences—and completely different actions that follow.

### Fear Narrows Attention

Here's what makes this tricky: **strong emotions—especially fear—dramatically narrow attention.**

When you're afraid, your focus contracts. Your nervous system is looking for the threat. It's not taking in the whole picture. It's scanning for danger.

This means:

- A woman who feels afraid around men may genuinely not see his vulnerability
- A man who's been falsely accused may genuinely not see her fear
- A bystander caught up in mob energy may genuinely not see the accused person's humanity

**They're not being malicious. They're not choosing to ignore the other perspective.** Their fear is directing their attention to one part of the elephant, and they never even realized there was more to see.

This is why people can still cause harm even without intending to. They're just afraid. And fear makes the world look smaller than it is.

Here's the dangerous part: **when fear enters a room, all the blind men teleport to the trunk.**

They all feel the trunk. They all conclude it's a snake. They all freak out together. And because they all agree, they become even more certain they're right.

But they're not right. It's still an elephant. Fear just caused them all to perceive the scariest part—and unanimous agreement among frightened people doesn't make the snake real.

### When Accusations Occur

Here's what happens when someone makes a high-severity accusation—calling someone a predator, saying they were assaulted, demanding removal:

**Everyone's RAS shifts.**

Before the accusation, people were in "friends and fun" mode. Their attention was on connection, pleasure, the experience they came for. Every rustle in the bushes was assumed to be a friend.

After the accusation, everyone shifts to "threat detection" mode. A scary word was spoken. Now their reticular activating system is scanning for danger. Every rustle in the bushes is assumed to be a hungry wolf.

**And many of them will find a predator—even if one doesn't exist.**

Not consciously. They're not choosing to see threats. But everything they witness is now filtered through their activated RAS. Confirmation bias kicks in. Ambiguous behaviors that would have been ignored five minutes ago now become "evidence." The accused person's nervousness becomes proof of guilt. Their defense becomes manipulation. Their confusion becomes deception.

This is how witch hunts form. Not from evidence, but from collective attention shift. Once the word "predator" is spoken, everyone starts looking for predators—and the human brain is very good at finding what it's looking for.

**This is why [verification matters](./before-you-judge.md).** The first story isn't evidence. It's a trigger that changes what everyone is looking for. And what they find afterward is contaminated by what they were primed to see.

### The Self-Reinforcing Cycle

Here's where it gets truly insidious:

Imagine a room where there are no predators. None. Everyone present has good intentions.

Someone with trauma around predators sees a shadow on the wall—an ambiguous touch, an awkward moment, a misread signal. Their body reacts: *predator.* They sound the alarm.

Now the room shifts. Everyone's RAS activates. People start scanning for threats. Someone fawns and apologizes—not because they did anything wrong, but because they're afraid. The apology looks like a confession. Others see the "confession" and think: *See? There really was a predator.*

The event ends. Everyone goes home with the same story: *There was a predator in the room. It was terrifying. I need to be more vigilant next time.*

**But there was no predator.**

The trauma created a predator that wasn't there. The collective reaction created "evidence" that confirmed the story. And now everyone's trauma is *stronger*—more certain that predators are everywhere, more primed to see them next time, more likely to create the same cycle again.

The person who was called a predator—the one who made an unconscious mistake or did nothing wrong at all—is the one who suffered the most real harm. And even the bystanders who just watched are now carrying reinforced fear that will distort their perception in every future space they enter.

No predator was ever present. But the trauma fed itself, proved itself, and grew. The shadow on the wall was a kitten and a candle. But everyone left believing it was a tiger.

### When the Room Splinters

Here's a signal that stories are running:

**Something happens, and the room can't agree on what it was.**

Half the people are screaming predator. Others say it was nothing. Some have a different take entirely but aren't speaking up because they're afraid of the loudest voices. Emotions are high. Narratives are competing. The loudest story—usually the scariest one—dominates.

This disagreement isn't evidence that the truth is somewhere in the middle. It's evidence that almost no one is looking at reality yet. They're reacting from their own filters, their own trauma, their own stories about what "must have" happened.

The person closest to reality in that moment will be the one asking questions. Not jumping to conclusions. Not making assumptions in panicked urgency. Just asking: *What actually happened here?*

If everyone paused and genuinely investigated—talked to primary sources, separated [notice from story](../tools/notice-feel-story.md), verified before acting—they'd converge. Because reality is one thing. When people are seeing wildly different things, it's not because reality is complicated. It's because stories are running.

### The Invitation

When you notice yourself certain about what happened—certain about who's wrong, who's a threat, who's the victim—pause and ask:

- Where is my attention right now?
- What parts of this situation am I not seeing?
- What would someone with different fears focus on?
- Am I touching the trunk and calling it a snake?

### Don't Act From Fear

Here's a principle that will save you from regret:

**If you're acting from fear, pause.**

This isn't about telling you what to do. Whatever decision you're considering—that's your choice. But if you're making it while afraid, it's probably not going to lead to happiness or get you what you actually want. Fear contracts attention. Fear distorts perception. Fear makes everything look like a threat.

Decisions made from fear tend to be decisions you regret.

Wait until the fear subsides. Come back to it with a clear mind and well-adjusted feelings. Then decide. You might reach the same conclusion—but now it's a conclusion, not a reaction.

If you can't wait—if action is required immediately—at least acknowledge: _"I'm acting from fear right now. I might be wrong about what I'm seeing."_ That acknowledgment alone creates a small gap between stimulus and response. And sometimes that gap is enough to prevent harm.

### You Become the Thing You Fear

Here's the pattern this book keeps showing you:

Someone causes harm—through an unconscious mistake or a harmful belief. You see the harm. You get afraid. You assume it was intentional. You assume they're selfish, malicious, dangerous. You label them a predator. You attack.

**But they weren't a predator. They were confused, unconscious, or operating on a bad belief.** And now you're causing harm through *your* harmful belief—the belief that they were evil. You're doing the exact thing you were afraid of.

The Inquisitor feared heretics destroying civilization—so he destroyed lives. The Rescuer feared a predator in the community—so she destroyed a reputation. The parent feared their child wouldn't be strong enough to survive a harsh world—so they [became the harsh world](../origin.md).

Every one of them became the harm they were trying to prevent. Not despite their fear—*because* of it. Fear drove them to act without verification, without proportionality, without seeing clearly. And the actions they took in that state caused more damage than the thing they were afraid of.

**This is the central warning of this book:** Your fear of harm is itself the most likely source of harm. The thing you're trying to prevent is the thing you'll create—if you let fear drive your actions.

The Inquisitor didn't wake up and decide to be evil. He woke up afraid. And fear did the rest.

## Sex Is Politics

Here's something that explains why people are so bad at seeing clearly in these spaces:

**When a topic becomes political, people stop thinking.**

There's a [fascinating study](https://youtu.be/zB_OApdxcno?si=TdsW5Isfr8Jsw9QM) where researchers gave people a chart with numbers and asked them to draw conclusions. When the topic was neutral (like a skin cream's effectiveness), people with high numeracy skills got the right answers regardless of their beliefs.

But when the exact same numbers were presented in a political context (gun control), something changed. People stopped analyzing the data. They came with preconceived conclusions and worked backward to justify them. Even the smartest, most numerate people failed—because they weren't doing math anymore. They were defending their tribe.

**Sex is politics.**

Even if you've never been traumatized, even if you've never witnessed victimization firsthand, you've grown up in a culture that:

- Teaches you to fear potential predators everywhere
- Gives you strong preconceived notions about victims and perpetrators
- Programs you with "correct" opinions about how things should be handled
- Fills you with stories about the drama triangle before you ever encounter a real situation

When something happens in an intimate space, most people don't analyze what actually occurred. They don't look at the data. They come with preconceived conclusions and work backward.

They're not responding to reality. They're defending cultural programming.

This is why someone can witness a LOW severity accident and genuinely believe they saw a HIGH severity assault. They're not lying. They're not stupid. **They're operating from filters, not facts.**

And this is why the frameworks in this book matter. They give you a way to override the automatic political response and actually look at what happened.

## What Trauma Actually Is

Trauma is a **story stored in the body.**

It's not just a memory. It's a meaning-making pattern that runs automatically, below conscious awareness, telling you:

> "You are in danger. This is an emergency. Take action NOW."

When something in the present resembles something from the past—even vaguely—the trauma pattern activates. The body floods with stress hormones. The thinking brain goes offline. And one of four automatic responses takes over:

### The Four Trauma Responses

| Response   | What It Looks Like                       | The Story Running                 |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Fight**  | Aggression, pushing back, attacking      | "I must destroy the threat"       |
| **Flight** | Leaving, avoiding, running away          | "I must escape the threat"        |
| **Freeze** | Going still, shutting down, dissociating | "If I don't move, maybe it stops" |
| **Fawn**   | People-pleasing, agreeing, appeasing     | "If I make them happy, I'm safe"  |

None of these are conscious choices. They're automatic programs running from old stories.

### Film Example: The Iron Giant

[📽️ Watch the clip](https://youtu.be/BPvtRdOMzeg?si=cPGZR206wnRQft71)

In this scene, Hogarth pulls out a toy gun. The Iron Giant's automatic defense programming kicks in—lasers fire from his eyes before he can stop himself. He almost kills the child he loves.

- **High severity** — could have caused permanent harm
- **Unconscious** — not a choice, automatic programming
- **Not malicious** — the Giant would never choose to hurt Hogarth

The Giant didn't want to do it. He wasn't thinking. His programming—like trauma, like a reflex—took over before his conscious mind could intervene. Something in the present (toy gun) resembled something from the past (real weapon), and an automatic response fired.

This is what trauma responses look like. They're not bad. They're not malicious. Something automatic fired that the person didn't choose. And the person didn't even know that trigger existed until it activated.

The Iron Giant is pure goodness—but lacks wisdom about his own nature. He doesn't know what will trigger his programming. That's why goodness alone isn't enough. (See: ["Goodness without wisdom always accomplishes evil"](./i-made-a-mistake.md#why-mistakes-are-necessary))

### The Problem: Old Stories, New Situations

Trauma responses were adaptive once. They helped you survive something.

The problem is they keep running **even when the danger is gone.**

Someone makes an innocent mistake, and your body screams "PREDATOR!" Someone asks you a question, and you freeze. Someone expresses disappointment, and you fawn to make it okay.

The experience is new. But you're reacting to an old story.

### Trauma Lives in the Body, Not the Mind

If you think these patterns are purely intellectual—that you can think your way out of them—you'll never solve them.

In *My Grandmother's Hands*, Resmaa Menakem makes this point about racism: it's not a problem of the mind. It's a trauma stored in the body. When someone with that body story sees a Black person, they don't consciously decide to feel afraid. Their body reacts—muscles tense, heart rate spikes, threat detection activates—before any conscious thought occurs.

Here's an example from the book that shows exactly how this plays out:

A crime occurred. A police officer arrived on scene. A Black man was present—he may have even been the one who called the police. He'd done nothing wrong. But when the officer arrived, the Black man immediately got on the ground, lowered his head, and put his arms above his head. He was afraid of the cop and wanted to show he wasn't a threat.

The officer shot him. Multiple times. Hit him in the leg.

The Black man called out: *"Why did you shoot me?"*

The officer paused. Then answered: *"I don't know."*

**"I don't know."** That's not intellectual racism. That's a body story firing. The officer's trauma response activated—something about the situation triggered "threat"—and his body acted before his conscious mind could intervene. When his conscious mind caught up, it had no explanation. Because there wasn't one. It was automatic.

And notice the [fawning](./fawning.md) parallel: the Black man's fear response—getting on the ground, making himself small—may have been the very thing that triggered the officer's body story. His submission looked like guilt. His fear looked like evidence. The fawning created the outcome it was trying to prevent.

If the Black man had been standing casually—relaxed energy, "Thanks, officer, glad you're here"—the outcome may have been completely different. The officer would have read a calm person who was there to help, not a threat. But because the Black man was afraid, his body communicated danger to the officer's body. And the officer's body reacted.

**This is because most communication is nonverbal.** Your words tell someone what to think. Your body tells them how to feel about it. If you say "I got fired today" in a panic, they'll panic with you. If you say "I got fired today" with a smile and ease, they'll feel like it's not a big deal—even though the words are identical.

The Black man's words didn't matter. His body communicated: *I am afraid of you.* And the officer's body concluded: *He should be afraid of me.* And it came up with its own explanations as to why, a.k.a. they did something wrong, they're the criminal. 

This is the same dynamic described throughout this book. Someone [fawns](./fawning.md), and their appeasement gets interpreted as a confession. Someone acts afraid, and their fear gets interpreted as evidence of wrongdoing. The body story creates the behavior that confirms the other person's body story.

This isn't about racism specifically. Racism is one manifestation of a universal pattern: **trauma stored in the body causes automatic reactions that harm people—and the person causing harm often can't explain why they did it.** Because it wasn't a decision. It was a reflex.

### How Subtle Stories Create Real Problems

Here's what makes this tricky: **you might not even know your story exists.**

You can do years of healing work and still have a subtle lens you've never examined—a background hum of meaning-making that's so normal to you that you don't recognize it as a filter.

**Example: The "I'm Being Left Out" Lens**

Imagine someone with a deep, unexamined story: "I'm always being excluded."

They might not consciously think this. But their perception is subtly biased toward seeing exclusion everywhere:

- When two people whisper, they assume it's about them
- When someone gets attention they don't, they feel passed over
- When ambiguous situations arise, they interpret them as "everyone else is getting something I'm not"

Now put this person in a play space. They're tired. Their thinking brain is offline. And something ambiguous happens—maybe they see movement that could be interpreted multiple ways.

Their "exclusion" filter kicks in automatically:

> "They're doing something I'm not included in."

And from that interpretation—which may or may not be accurate—they take an action. An action they might not have taken if they'd seen the situation clearly.

To everyone else, it looks like a boundary violation out of nowhere. To them, they were just "joining in" with what they thought was already happening.

**The mistake wasn't malicious.** They weren't trying to harm anyone. But their unconscious story distorted their perception, and their perception drove their behavior.

### Why This Matters

This is **exceedingly subtle.**

You don't normally think: "My tendency to feel excluded is affecting my actions right now." You just... see what you see. And act on what you see.

But what you see is filtered through stories you may have never examined.

In play spaces, where:

- Stakes are high
- Bodies are involved
- Consent depends on accurate perception
- You might be tired, altered, or emotionally activated

...these subtle filters can create real problems.

### Stories and the Problems They Create

| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "I'm always being left out"          | Sees exclusion everywhere; interprets ambiguous situations as "they're doing something without me" | Misreads what's happening, acts on false interpretation, creates boundary violations from confusion            |
| "Everyone wants what I have"         | Paranoid about partner; assumes every friendly interaction is someone trying to steal them         | Accuses innocent people of predatory behavior, creates conflict, drives partner away with jealousy             |
| "People always take advantage of me" | Sees manipulation in normal requests; assumes the worst intent                                     | Over-reacts to low-severity situations, shuts down connection, may launch [witch hunts](./before-you-judge.md) |
| "I'm not worthy of attention"        | Assumes rejection is coming; doesn't believe genuine interest                                      | [Fawns](./fawning.md) instead of setting boundaries, says yes when they mean no, gets hurt                     |

| "Facilitators are perfect"           | Expects staff to never make mistakes; sees any error as proof of predation                         | Over-responds to normal human error, starts witch hunts, destroys careers over accidents                       |
| "I would never do that"              | Can't imagine making certain mistakes; assumes anyone who does must be malicious                   | Blind to own risk (more likely to make that mistake), crucifies others for accidents they can't conceive of    |

**Example: "Everyone Wants What I Have"**

A couple comes to a play party together. One partner has an unexamined story: "Everyone wants what I have. People are always trying to take what's mine."

At the party, someone chats warmly with their partner. Just friendly conversation—nothing flirtatious.

But through the jealousy filter:

> "They're trying to steal my partner. I need to intervene."

They pull their partner away, act cold to the "threat," maybe even confront them later. The other person is confused and hurt—they were just being friendly.

The jealous partner might even go further: warning others that this person is "predatory," starting whispers, creating [high-severity](./severity.md) consequences for someone who did nothing wrong.

**Here's the problem: they genuinely believe their story.**

It's not that they're being irrational. Within their reference frame—where "everyone wants what I have" is a core axiom—their actions make perfect sense. If you truly believe others are trying to steal your partner, of course you'd act defensive. Of course you'd push people away. Of course you'd warn others about the "threat."

The harm they're creating feels like self-defense. They think they're responding to high-severity aggression against them—but it's not true at all.

This is why stories are so dangerous. The person acting from them isn't crazy. They're just operating from false premises they don't know are false.

**The tool:** When someone's behavior looks "purely selfish" or "purely evil," there's almost always a belief underneath that makes it make sense to them. Ask: **What would this person have to believe about the world for this to be a rational response?** That question reveals the hidden premise—the filter running their perception.

**Example: "Facilitators Are Perfect"**

This one is especially common among newcomers to sex-positive spaces.

Someone attends their first retreat or play party. They see facilitators and staff who've been in this world for years. They see confidence, skill, experience. And they form a story:

> "These people know everything. They've seen everything. They don't make mistakes."

This is a myth. Facilitators are human. Staff are human. They make mistakes like everyone else—unconscious slips, moments of impairment, autopilot errors. Years of experience reduce mistakes; they don't eliminate them.

But if you're carrying the "facilitators are perfect" filter, here's what happens when a staff member makes a normal human mistake:

Your filter says: "Experienced people don't make mistakes. Therefore this wasn't a mistake. It was intentional. They're a predator using their position to take advantage of people."

Note: these words may never consciously go through your head. The belief that facilitators are perfect might be entirely subconscious—just part of how you see the world. The idea that facilitators are _not_ perfect may not be something you've ever consciously considered, much less put into words.

So when something happens, it doesn't work like an inner monologue stepping through logic. You see a staff member make a mistake, and your reference frame—which literally does not allow for the possibility of innocent error from experienced people—produces only one interpretation: predator. You're not _concluding_ they're a predator. You're _perceiving_ it, because your filter doesn't offer any other option.

You skip right past accident to malice. You skip right past LOW to HIGH severity. Because in your reference frame, the only explanation for staff error is predation.

**The irony:** Facilitators and experienced staff are typically the _safest_ people in the room. They've made their mistakes, learned from them, trained extensively, and developed refined awareness. They're the least likely to cause harm—and the most equipped to handle it well when they do.

But the "facilitators are perfect" filter inverts reality. When the safest person makes a minor slip, they're suddenly perceived as the biggest threat—because "someone that experienced wouldn't make a mistake unless they meant to."

The filter causes people to attack the lowest-risk participants while potentially overlooking actual risks from less experienced people who haven't yet learned what the veterans have.

It's the "meet your heroes and be disappointed" effect. The disappointment isn't because your heroes are secretly terrible—it's because they were never superhuman to begin with. The myth was yours, not theirs.

**This filter is why some containers don't allow facilitators or staff to play with participants.**

Not because facilitators are dangerous. Not because staff can't be trusted. But because:

1. **Participants project perfection onto them** — and perfection is impossible
2. **When mistakes inevitably happen, the filter amplifies them** — a LOW mistake from staff gets perceived as HIGH because "they should have known better"
3. **The perceived power dynamic intensifies the over-response** — "they used their position" when actually they just slipped like any human would
4. **Having a neutral party to hold space matters** — if the angry person is mad at the facilitator, who holds the container?

Some containers allow assistants to play but not lead facilitators. Same logic—the more authority someone appears to have, the more the perfection myth applies, the more dangerous the over-response when they inevitably prove human.

**The reality:**

Facilitators have seen more than you. They have more experience. They probably have more wisdom about these dynamics.

They are still human. They will still make mistakes. And when they do, the appropriate question is the same as for anyone: What [type of mistake](./types-of-mistakes.md) was it? What's the actual [severity](./severity.md)? Is your [response appropriate](./appropriate-response.md)?

Not: "How could someone experienced do this? They must be a predator."

If you catch yourself thinking that, you're in the filter. Check it.

**Example: "I Would Never Do That"**

This filter often compounds with "Facilitators are perfect"—and it's especially common in newcomers.

Someone new to these spaces hasn't read this book. They don't know about [unconscious mistakes](./types-of-mistakes.md#why-unconscious-mistakes-happen)—autopilot errors, impairment slips, hunger-driven moments where the conscious mind wasn't driving.

> **They've never learned that their own body can do things their conscious mind wouldn't choose.**

[Fawning](./fawning.md) is a perfect example. Someone says yes when they mean no—not because they chose to lie, but because their body produced the word before their conscious mind could intervene. Their mouth said yes while their mind was screaming no. If you've ever fawned, you already know what it's like for your body to act against your conscious will.

The same thing happens on the other side of the interaction. Someone's hand moves somewhere it shouldn't—not because they chose to violate a boundary, but because their autopilot fired before their conscious mind caught it.

If you understand fawning, you already have the reference frame to understand unconscious boundary crossings. They're the same mechanism pointing in different directions.

So when newcomers imagine a boundary violation, they can only imagine it as a choice. A conscious decision to harm someone. Because that's the only mechanism they know.

This creates a double problem:

**1. They're blind to their own risk.**

If you can't conceive of making an unconscious mistake, you won't take precautions against it. You won't learn the [Gun Test](../tools/gun-test.md). You won't train safety checks into your autopilot. You won't think "maybe I shouldn't play when I'm this tired."

The person who thinks "I would never do that" is often the person most likely to do exactly that—because they're not watching for it. They're the newbie with no trained safety mechanisms, walking into high-stakes situations with the confidence of someone who doesn't know what they don't know.

**2. They crucify others for mistakes they can't conceive of.**

When they see someone cross a boundary, they have no mental category for "unconscious accident." The only explanation their reference frame offers is: "They meant to do that. They're a predator."

They're not being malicious. They genuinely can't imagine another explanation. But the result is the same: they launch [HIGH severity responses](./severity.md) to LOW severity accidents, destroy reputations over moments of unconsciousness, and create witch hunts based on their own inability to conceive of how mistakes actually happen.

**The painful irony:**

The newcomer who thinks "I would never do that" is:

- More likely to make that exact mistake (because they're not guarding against it)
- Most likely to cause real harm (their attack feels like defense to them)
- The least qualified to judge what happened (because they don't understand the mechanisms)

Meanwhile, the veteran who HAS made that mistake and learned from it:

- Is less likely to make it again (because they've trained against it)
- Is more likely to recognize it as an accident when they see it (because they understand how it happens)
- Is more qualified to assess what actually occurred (because they have the reference frame)

The people who think they'd never make a mistake are the most dangerous—both to themselves and to everyone they might judge.

**This pattern in action:**

During a group exercise, men are invited to embody their strength—shouting, flexing, expressing power. One participant looks uncomfortable. He says something like: "Isn't this what toxic masculinity is? Isn't this what we're supposed to stop?"

Notice where his attention already is: scanning for predators, toxic people, threats that need to be stopped. His reticular activating system is primed for danger before anything has happened. Everyone else sees a strength exercise. He sees potential abusers.

He's identified a type of behavior he rejects. Aggressive masculinity. Loud, dominating energy. He can't imagine himself doing that. He's here to be different.

Later, someone makes a mistake. A LOW or MEDIUM severity accident.

This same participant—the one who couldn't imagine being aggressively masculine—becomes the loudest person in the room. Shouting. Screaming. More anger than anyone has seen in years. Rushing to rescue, ready to harm anyone in his path who might interfere with his righteous cause. Publicly calling the other person a predator. Spreading it to others. Getting the room to take sides before anyone verified what actually happened. Causing HIGH severity harm to someone who made a LOW severity mistake.

He's doing exactly what he said he was against. Aggressive. Dominating. Threatening. The only person in the room causing real harm.

And he can't see it.

Because in his reference frame, he's not being toxic—he's stopping a predator. He's not being aggressive—he's protecting the vulnerable. He's not causing harm—he's delivering justice.

The filter that made him unable to imagine himself as harmful is exactly what made him blind to being harmful. He became the embodiment of what he thought he was fighting against.

This happens more than people realize. The person most afraid of being X is often the person most likely to become X—because they're not watching for it in themselves. They've decided they're immune.

### When Filters Find Each Other

Here's something that makes this worse: **complementary filters magnetize.**

Consider someone whose subconscious runs this story: "People are going to misunderstand me and attack me."

They might not consciously think this. But their body knows it. Every time their phone buzzes—a text, a call, a notification—they get a jolt of fear. _Is someone mad at me? Did they see some imperfection and now they think I'm deserving to be screamed at?_

They're not choosing to think this. Their nervous system just fires. Years of being misunderstood have trained their RAS to expect attack.

This story doesn't just distort perception. **It creates the thing it fears.**

Say they're on a team. They make a minor error—the kind everyone makes. But they hyper-focus on it: _Oh no, someone might misunderstand this._ So they proactively bring it up at the team meeting, trying to seem accountable.

The problem: everyone makes these mistakes, but no one else mentions theirs. Now this person is the only one the team hears making errors. Week after week. Their confessions are training everyone else's RAS: _This person is mistake-prone. Watch them._

They think they're being responsible. They're actually painting a target on themselves.

**And then comes the fawning.**

When someone does confront them—angry, accusing—their fear kicks in. Part of the fear is the story: _I don't know how to handle this. If I defend myself, it'll get worse._

So instead of saying "This is unreasonable. You can't speak to me this way. If you want to talk with dignity and respect, I'm available—otherwise, I'm not"—instead of that, they try to appease. They explain their actions, which to the attacker looks like manipulation, trying to get out of trouble. The attack intensifies.

They apologize—not because they did anything wrong, but because apologizing makes angry people less angry. Fawning.

But to the attacker, the apology looks like a confession. It reinforces the attacker's story: _See? They admitted it. I was right._

**The person never showed any other possibility.** They never took action that would make the attacker question what they were seeing. Their fear of being misunderstood and attacked caused them to take exactly the actions that caused people to misunderstand and attack them.

---

Now put these two people in the same room:

- **Person A:** RAS primed for predators. "They're everywhere. I need to find them."
- **Person B:** RAS primed for attack. "People will misunderstand me and explode."

You don't have to consciously put them together. They're like magnets. They'll find each other.

Person A is scanning for threats. Person B is anxious, apologetic, constantly flagging their own mistakes—which looks suspicious to someone hunting predators. Person A confronts. Person B fawns and explains—which looks like manipulation. Person A escalates. Person B apologizes for things they didn't do—which Person A sees as reinforcing their story.

This happens like magic. Neither intended it. But their reticular activating systems were looking for something with polarity—and they found each other.

**The painful irony:**

> The people most afraid of being harmed are most likely to cause harm—by seeing and attacking false predators.
>
> The people most afraid of being misunderstood and attacked are most likely to wind up being attacked.

Both feel like victims. Both think the other person proved their story right. Neither realizes they co-created the dynamic from complementary fears.

**The way out:**

If either one calmed down and re-centered, the dynamic dissolves.

If Person A relaxed and said, "I'm in a safe place. I don't need to scan for predators every second"—they'd stop seeing threats in anxious people.

If Person B relaxed and stopped looking for signs they're about to be attacked—they'd stop taking the defensive actions that look suspicious.

If their reticular activating systems focused on literally anything else, both would be less likely to find what they're expecting to find. They might even find their patterns funny. They might even be friends.

### The Invitation

This isn't about being paranoid about your every perception.

It's about humility:

> "I might have stories I don't know about. My interpretation might not be accurate. Before I act—especially on something significant—let me check."

This is why [Notice, Feel, Story](../tools/notice-feel-story.md) and [Before You Judge](./before-you-judge.md) matter so much. They're tools for catching your filters before they cause harm.

## The Problem in Sex-Positive Spaces

When a boundary violation occurs, what do you assume about the person who made it?

- Do you assume the best or the worst?
- What meaning do you ascribe to mistakes?
- Do you know you have trauma that causes your interpretations to lean a certain way?

### How Trauma Distorts Everything

Trauma creates subconscious filters. You may not even know you have trauma. It may just be one of those filters you view the world through.

**A belief and narrative about the world and what happened to you.**

Whatever comes up—whatever mistake someone makes, you make it, they make it—you're going to view everything through your beliefs and filters, **which are not necessarily real.**

Someone's hand brushes your thigh:

- Without trauma filter: "That was probably accidental. I'll mention my boundary if it happens again."
- With trauma filter: "They're testing me. This is how it starts. I need to protect myself."

Both interpretations create very different [appropriate responses](./appropriate-response.md).

One leads to a simple conversation. The other might lead to accusations, witch hunts, or [high-severity](./severity.md) responses to a low-severity mistake.

## Limiting Beliefs & Primary Questions

(Concept from Tony Robbins' Date with Destiny)

There may be a single sentence running your life and tainting how you see everything in the world.

Examples:

- "People always hurt me"
- "I'm not safe"
- "Men/women can't be trusted"
- "I have to protect myself at all costs"
- "If I let my guard down, I'll be taken advantage of"
- "People only want one thing from me"

These aren't conscious beliefs you chose. They were installed by experiences—often in childhood—and they run automatically.

These filters will distort:

- How you interpret others' [types of mistakes](./types-of-mistakes.md)
- How you assess [severity](./severity.md)
- Whether your [response is appropriate](./appropriate-response.md)
- Whether you see someone as a predator or a person who made a mistake

## Checking Your Stories

The good news: once you understand that feelings come from stories, you can **check your stories.**

Before you react, pause and ask:

1. **What happened?** (Just the facts—what a camera would have recorded)
2. **What story am I telling myself about it?**
3. **Is that story definitely true, or is it an assumption?**
4. **What other stories could explain what happened?**

This is the core of the [Notice, Feel, Story](../tools/notice-feel-story.md) tool—a practical technique for separating experience from interpretation.

### Example

**Experience:** He touched my lower back without asking.

**My story:** He's testing my boundaries to see what he can get away with. This is predatory behavior.

**Possible alternative stories:**

- He's affectionate and thought we had a connection
- In his culture, that touch is normal and friendly
- He wasn't thinking and did it automatically
- He genuinely didn't know I'd mind

**What would help:** Asking him directly. Using [Notice, Feel, Story](../tools/notice-feel-story.md) to check instead of assuming.

## Responsibility When You Have Trauma

Having trauma is **not your fault.**

How you handle it when interacting with others **is your responsibility.**

This isn't blame. It's [empowerment](./responsibility.md). You're the only one who can:

- Know your triggers
- Communicate them when possible
- Pause before reacting
- Ask: "Is this about NOW or about THEN?"
- Check your stories before acting on them
- Take [100% control](../tools/100-percent-control.md) of your safety

### The Hard Truth

Your trauma responses can harm others.

If your body screams "PREDATOR!" and you act on that—spreading warnings, starting witch hunts, destroying someone's reputation—you may be creating [high-severity](./severity.md) harm to someone who made an innocent mistake.

Your fear felt real. Your story felt true. But the consequences you created are still your responsibility.

This isn't fair. You didn't ask for trauma. But the people you harm didn't ask for your trauma responses either.

### The Path Forward

Healing isn't about suppressing your responses. It's about:

1. **Recognizing** when you're reacting to old stories
2. **Pausing** before taking action
3. **Checking** your story with the people involved
4. **Choosing** your response consciously instead of automatically

Over time, with practice and often with support, the old stories lose their grip. The gap between trigger and response grows longer. You gain the ability to feel the fear without acting from it.

This is what it means to take responsibility for your trauma while also having compassion for yourself.
