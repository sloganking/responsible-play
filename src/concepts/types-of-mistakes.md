# Types of Mistakes

← [Back to Introduction](../introduction.md)

---

Here's what destroys people in these spaces:

**Treating an accident like malice.**

Someone's hand slips. Someone misreads a cue. Someone gets carried away for a moment. It was unconscious, unintentional, immediately regretted.

And then the response: "Predator." "Rapist." "You need to leave and never come back." Public shaming. Reputation destroyed.

A LOW or MEDIUM severity accident. Met with a HIGH severity response designed for malice.

**The person who made the mistake wasn't the predator. The person who responded became one.**

This is why TYPE matters. The same action can be malicious or accidental—and the appropriate response is completely different. Get the type wrong, and you become the source of harm.

## The Core Types

| Type          | Description                  | What It Looks Like | Response                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| **Malicious** | Intentional harm             | They knew. They did it anyway. They wanted to. | Accountability, consequences          |
| **Accident**  | Unintentional, unconscious   | Hand slipped. Got carried away. Didn't notice. | Education, awareness                  |
| **Wrong Thinking** | Conscious but misguided | They thought it was okay. It wasn't. | Correct the belief                    |
| **Fawning**   | Person said yes but meant no | Two victims. See [Fawning](./fawning.md). | Complex—both have responsibility |

## The Key Question

Before you respond, ask:

> **Did they KNOW they were causing harm?**

If yes → They had the chance to stop and didn't. That's closer to malice.

If no → They didn't know. Treating them like they knew is unfair and harmful.

Most mistakes in these spaces are the second kind. People aren't thinking. They get carried away. They misread. They assume. They're operating from wrong beliefs they've never examined.

**Predators are rare. Clumsy humans are common.** If you treat every clumsy human like a predator, you'll destroy good people while actual predators blend in.

## By Awareness

| Type                          | Description                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Conscious, wrong thinking** | They were thinking, but thinking wrong                                              |
| **Unconscious, not thinking** | Autopilot, sleepy, careless — the [Popcorn](../tools/popcorn-metaphor.md) situation |

The difference matters:

- **Wrong thinking** needs education. They believed something false—like "hickeys just happen" or "silence means consent." Correct the belief, and the behavior changes.

- **Unconscious** needs a wake-up call. They weren't thinking at all. They need to become aware, not be taught—they probably already know better when they're conscious.

## Common Patterns

These aren't excuses—they're explanations. Understanding the pattern helps determine the response.

### Boundary Drift

Gradual creep past lines without noticing.

*What it looks like:* Touch starts at the shoulder. Over an hour, it migrates. By the end, it's somewhere neither person explicitly agreed to. Neither noticed the drift in real-time.

*The response:* Wake-up call. Point out where it went. They probably didn't notice—and once they do, they're often mortified.

### Assumption

Acting on what you *think* someone wants.

*What it looks like:* "She seemed into it." "He didn't say no." "Last time they liked this." They filled in the blanks with assumptions instead of asking.

*The response:* Teach them to check instead of assume. The belief driving this: "I can read people well enough that I don't need to ask." That belief is wrong.

### Freezing

Person went silent/still, didn't communicate.

*What it looks like:* Something started happening. They didn't want it. But instead of speaking up, they froze—went quiet, dissociated, waited for it to be over.

*The response:* This is a trauma response, like fawning. The person who froze has [responsibility](./responsibility.md) to communicate, AND the other person has responsibility to notice something's wrong. Both have something to look at.

### Delayed Realization

Consented in the moment, realized later it wasn't okay.

*What it looks like:* They said yes. They meant it at the time. Hours or days later, they feel violated. Something shifted.

*The response:* Complex. Their consent was real in the moment. The other person acted in good faith. But the harm is also real. This often requires processing together, not blame. See [Making It Right](./making-it-right.md).

### How to Use the Matrix

Ask two questions:

1. **Did they mean to do it?** (Intentional vs Unintentional)
2. **Were they thinking?** (Conscious vs Unconscious)

The answers point you to the quadrant, and the quadrant tells you the response.

**Note on Fawning:** Fawning doesn't fit cleanly in this matrix—it's a trauma response that creates two victims. See [Fawning](./fawning.md).
