## The Core Principle: Walk Your Talk

Nothing matters more for a facilitator than alignment between what you say and what you do.

You can teach about consent, boundaries, and dignity all day. But what people learn is what they see you do when it's hard.

**Show, don't tell.**

If you say everyone deserves dignity and respect, but you let someone treat you like shit because you're scared of them—you've just taught everyone that dignity is negotiable when someone gets angry enough.

If you say mistakes don't require leaving the container, but you kick someone out because an angry participant scared you into it—you've just taught everyone that mob pressure wins.

Your actions are louder than your words. Every time.

## Everyone Deserves Dignity and Respect

### The Puja Principle

In tantra, there's a ritual called the puja—a practice of worshipping each other as gods and goddesses. The idea is to see the divine in each other and yourself.

For many people, this is the first time they've ever been treated with such reverence, appreciation, and dignity. It's profound. It's awakening. And afterward, many decide:

> "This is how I want to be treated for the rest of my life. I'm going to have boundaries and only allow people into my life who treat me as divine."

This isn't arrogance. It's self-worth.

### The Principle to Carry

We're all powerful creators, even if we don't recognize it yet. We're all valuable. We're all worth being treated with dignity and respect.

**None of us should be treated like crap.**

This isn't just a nice idea. It's a core value that should govern how you run your container—and how you allow yourself to be treated within it.

## When Someone Attacks You

Here's where it gets hard.

Someone is angry. They're doing character assassination. They're calling you names—predator, abuser, whatever. They're playing victim loudly. They might be threatening your reputation.

The temptation—especially for facilitators and staff—is to fawn. To appease. To let them treat you badly because:

- "Facilitators are supposed to stay calm"
- "I don't want to escalate"
- "They might write hate mail"
- "Maybe I deserve this"

**This is wrong.**

### The Appropriate Response

If someone is speaking to you without dignity and respect, you don't fawn. You set a boundary.

**For participants and assistants:**

> "I can see you're angry, and I'm open to having a conversation about what happened. But I'm not available for being spoken to this way. Until you're willing to speak to me with dignity and respect, you're going to have to handle your emotions on your own."

Then disengage. You don't owe them your presence while they attack you.

If you're at a retreat and can't leave, talk to the facilitators. Set a boundary that this person doesn't interact with you unless they can treat you with dignity and respect.

**For staff:**

The same applies. Being staff doesn't mean you forfeit your right to be treated with respect.

If you model "staff don't defend themselves," you're teaching participants that they can treat you like shit and nothing will happen. You're showing that your values are negotiable.

That's not the lesson you want to teach.

### What You're Modeling

When you set a boundary with someone who's attacking you, you model:

- Self-respect is non-negotiable
- Dignity applies to everyone—including the accused
- Anger doesn't grant permission to abuse
- Values hold even when things get hard

When you fawn and appease, you model:

- Anger wins
- If you're loud enough, you get your way
- Facilitators/staff are afraid of participants
- The person crying victim controls the container

**Which lesson do you want participants to learn?**

## The Facilitator's Dilemma

Lead facilitators face a unique challenge.

You're responsible for the container. You're supposed to hold space for everyone. You're supposed to stay calm. There's an expectation that you'll be the adult in the room.

But that doesn't mean you accept abuse.

## Show, Don't Tell

Your participants learn more from what you do than what you say.

| What You Say                    | What You Do                                  | What They Learn                  |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| "Everyone deserves respect"     | You let someone disrespect you               | Respect is optional when angry   |
| "Mistakes don't mean leaving"   | You kick someone out under pressure          | Mob pressure wins                |
| "We verify before judging"      | You take action based on one side            | Verification is lip service      |
| "Proportional responses matter" | You let HIGH responses to LOW mistakes slide | Severity doesn't actually matter |

**If your actions contradict your words, your actions are what people remember.**

This is why walking your talk is the most important thing as a facilitator. Not your curriculum. Not your marketing. Not your reputation.

Your integrity.

## What to Do When Someone Reports

_[Section in development: Protocol for when a participant reports an incident]_

1. Listen first, without judgment
2. Gather primary source information from all parties
3. Assess severity based on what actually happened
4. Respond proportionally
5. Don't let the reporter's emotional intensity determine your response
6. Remember: the reporter may be over-responding, fawning, or creating a story
