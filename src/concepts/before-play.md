## Prevention Is the Happy Path

Most of what this book covers is what to do when things go wrong. But the best way to handle mistakes is to prevent them.

Before engaging in play, intimacy, or sex with someone, have a conversation. Not just "do you consent?"—a real conversation that covers the things that, if you don't discuss them, often turn into the mistakes this book is about.

## What Is a "Good Thing"?

Let's define what we're trying to create:

> **A "good thing" is an experience where each participant feels good during the interaction AND after the interaction about what occurred.**

That's the goal. Not just pleasure in the moment—but something you both feel good about afterward.

The opposite is an hour of sexual pleasure followed by three months of emotional hell. That's not a good thing, even if it felt good in the moment.

RBDSMT exists to make sure what you're creating is a good thing, not a bad thing.

## RBDSMT: The Safer Sex Conversation

This framework comes from ISTA (International School of Temple Arts), with additions. It stands for:

- **R** — Relationships
- **B** — Boundaries
- **D** — Desires
- **S** — Sexual Health
- **M** — Meaning and Mistakes
- **T** — Trauma

Before playing with someone—especially someone new—talk through each of these. It takes 10-20 minutes. It can save hours of pain, confusion, and repair.

---

## R — Relationships

**What to discuss:** What are your current relationship structures? Who else is involved? What agreements do you have with others?

**Why it matters:** Playing with someone who has a partner you don't know about, or violating agreements they have with someone else, can create HIGH severity harm—not just to them, but to third parties.

**Example questions:**

- "Are you in any relationships right now?"
- "Do you have any agreements with partners that affect what we can do?"
- "Is there anyone who would be hurt or surprised by this?"
- "Is there anyone I should know about?"

---

## B — Boundaries

**What to discuss:** What's okay? What's not okay? What are your hard limits? What are your soft limits?

**Why it matters:** When you don't know someone's limits, respecting them becomes difficult. You're constantly second-guessing: "Can I do this? Can I do this?" That uncertainty creates anxiety for you and risk for them.

When you DO know their boundaries upfront:

- **You know what's safe.** You can play freely within the agreed space without constant questioning.
- **They're protected.** Clear limits are easier to respect than unstated ones.
- **You have ease.** You're not anxious about accidentally crossing a line you didn't know existed.
- **You're protected too.** If you were emotionally invested in something happening that wasn't actually available, knowing upfront prevents that hurt.

If they don't state their limits, they're also more likely to [fawn](./fawning.md) when something doesn't feel right—saying yes when they mean no, then feeling violated afterward.

**Example questions:**

- "What's off-limits for you?"
- "What are your hard no's?"
- "Is there anything you'd want me to check in about before doing?"
- "How do you like to communicate if something isn't working?"
- "What's your safeword, if you use one?"

---

## D — Desires

**What to discuss:** What do you actually want from this experience? What are you hoping for? What would make this great for you?

**Why it matters:** If you don't know what each other wants, you're guessing. Guessing leads to mismatches. Mismatches lead to disappointment or harm.

**Hidden benefits:**

- **Discovery:** They might mention something you didn't realize you wanted until they said it. "Oh—I want that too!"
- **Creative alternatives:** Instead of just "no," they can practice "no, but..." If you ask for something they're not available for, they might offer something similar that works for both of you. This expands possibilities instead of closing them down.

**Example questions:**

- "What are you hoping for from this?"
- "What would make this really good for you?"
- "Is there anything specific you'd love to experience?"
- "What are you curious about?"

---

## S — Sexual Health

**What to discuss:** STI status, testing history, safer sex practices, barriers, birth control, pregnancy.

**Why it matters:** This is about physical safety and informed consent. You can't consent to a risk you don't know about.

**Important:** If they have other partners or have had sex recently, ask what protection methods they used. A negative test from a month ago doesn't account for unprotected sex they had last week. You need the full picture.

**Example questions:**

- "When were you last tested? For what?"
- "Is there anything I should know about your sexual health?"
- "Have you had other partners since your last test? What protection did you use?"
- "What safer sex practices do you want to use?"
- "What are your preferences around barriers?"
- "What's your birth control situation?"
- "What would happen if pregnancy occurred? What would you want to do?"

---

## M — Meaning and Mistakes

**What to discuss:** What does this mean to you? What are your expectations afterward? And critically: **How do you respond when mistakes happen?**

### Meaning

Mismatched meaning creates hurt. If one person thinks this is the start of a relationship and the other thinks it's a one-time thing, someone's getting hurt—and it's preventable.

**Example questions:**

- "What does this mean to you?"
- "What are your expectations for after?"
- "Is this casual for you, or something more?"
- "Does having sex with someone change your relationship with them? How?"
- "How do you usually feel after intimacy? Is there anything you need?"

Some people's meaning-making is extreme. For a few people, sex means "we're basically married now." You want to know if that's in their head before you engage.

### Mistakes

This is one of the most important questions you can ask:

> **"When mistakes happen—when a boundary gets accidentally crossed—do you tend to assume the best in people, or the worst?"**

**Why this matters:**

You need to know if you're playing with a gun to your head.

If you accidentally cross a boundary for a moment—your hand goes somewhere it shouldn't, you misread a cue—what happens?

- **Charitable interpretation:** "Hey, I think you forgot, but I have a boundary about that." You say "Oh, thank you for telling me," and appreciate their respectful response.
- **Uncharitable interpretation:** You're a rapist. Character assassination. Reputation destruction. [Witch hunt](./before-you-judge.md).

If you know someone responds to mistakes with HIGH severity—treating accidents like malice—you might choose not to play with them. You might choose someone whose interpretation of mistakes is charitable, who understands the difference between [accident and malice](./types-of-mistakes.md).

**Example questions:**

- "When someone makes a mistake with you, how do you usually respond?"
- "If I accidentally crossed a boundary, what would you want me to do? What would you do?"
- "Do you tend to assume good intent when things go wrong?"
- "Have you ever had an experience where someone made an innocent mistake and you responded strongly? What happened?"

This isn't about finding someone who will let you get away with things. It's about knowing what you're signing up for. If they can't tolerate accidents, and you're human (meaning you WILL make mistakes eventually), you're playing with fire.

---

## T — Trauma

**What to discuss:** Do you have any trauma that might get activated? What does activation look like for you? What should I do if it happens?

**Why it matters:** Trauma can turn a consensual experience into a dissociative nightmare. If you know their triggers and warning signs, you can navigate around them—or at least respond appropriately if something comes up.

**Example questions:**

- "Is there anything from your past that might get activated during play?"
- "Are there any touches, words, or situations I should avoid?"
- "What does it look like when you're activated or triggered?"
- "What would you want me to do if that happens?"
- "Do you have any [fawning](./fawning.md) patterns I should watch for?"

That last question is powerful. If they tell you upfront that they tend to fawn, you can watch for it and check in when their "yes" doesn't feel like a yes.

### Your Trauma Matters Too

This isn't just about their trauma—it's about yours.

**Personal example:** I have exclusion trauma. I spent years feeling left out, and I have trauma around not being touched. I was playing with someone who had the opposite—trauma about being touched too much. They were hesitant to touch me, which made sense for them, but I forgot to tell them about MY trauma.

Now I have a request I make upfront:

> "If we're headed toward sex and you decide you're no longer interested, please tell me immediately—as soon as you become aware. I have trauma around expecting something and then being let down. If I know early, I can adjust. If I find out at the last moment, it's much harder for me."

That's me taking [responsibility](./responsibility.md) for my own trauma. Not expecting them to read my mind—but communicating what I need so we can both have a good experience.

## This Is Taking Responsibility

Having this conversation before play is [taking responsibility](./responsibility.md) proactively.

You're not waiting for something to go wrong and then trying to repair it. You're creating the conditions for a **good thing**—where both people feel good during AND after.

**For facilitators:** Teaching participants to have this conversation before play is part of preparing them for temple nights and open play. If you skip this education, you're setting people up for the mistakes this book is about.

See: [Facilitator Protocols](./facilitator-protocols.md) — the responsible vs. irresponsible approach.

## A Personal Note from the Author

When I first learned RBDSMT, I thought: "This is great."

Then, a few months later, things are getting hot with someone. We're about to have sex. And I think: "Do I really need to have the full conversation? We're both adults. It'll probably be fine."

I skipped it. We had sex. And afterward, it wasn't a good thing. There was pain. Mismatched meaning. Hurt feelings. Drama.

I did that two or three more times. Each time, I skipped the conversation because it felt awkward or unnecessary in the moment. Each time, something went wrong.

Now? I have the full RBDSMT conversation every time before sex. No compromises. No exceptions. No "it's probably fine."

Because I'm tired of having sex and feeling like shit afterward. I'm tired of creating bad things when I could create good things. And the only difference is 15 minutes of conversation that I was too lazy or awkward to have.

Learn from my mistakes. Have the conversation.

---

## It Doesn't Have to Be Awkward

Some people resist these conversations because they feel clinical or mood-killing.

But:

1. **It can be sexy.** Talking about desires is foreplay. Knowing what someone wants makes it better.

2. **It builds trust.** Someone who's willing to have this conversation is someone who cares about your experience.

3. **It prevents way more awkwardness than it creates.** A 15-minute conversation now prevents hours of processing, repair, and drama later.

4. **It's a filter.** Someone who won't have this conversation is telling you something about how they'll handle things when they go wrong.
