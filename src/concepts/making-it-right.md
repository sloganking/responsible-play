# Making It Right

## The Goal

When a mistake occurs, the goal is **repair**, not punishment.

Rather than blaming, attacking, or going for an eye for an eye—if the person who made a mistake wants to make up for it, **allow them to make it right.**

## How to Make It Right

1. **Take responsibility and ownership** of what occurred
2. **Apologize with action**, not just words

### Apologizing with Action

"I'm sorry" is not enough if it leaves the other person still hurt.

Making it right means:

- Asking what they need
- Taking concrete steps
- Following through

### Create More Value Than Was Taken

Here's the gold standard for repair:

**Don't just restore what was lost. Create MORE value than was taken.**

When you make a mistake that hurt someone, you can apologize in a way that blows them out of the water. Go above and beyond. Make the repair so generous, so thoughtful, so clearly from a place of care, that their new reference frame for dealing with you becomes:

> "Even when unwanted mistakes happen with this person, I WIN."

Maybe they got something pleasurable out of it. Maybe they experienced a level of care they rarely receive. Maybe they saw that you take responsibility so thoroughly that they feel safer with you than before the mistake happened.

This is powerful. Most people don't do this. Most people give the minimum apology and hope it's enough. When you consistently add more value than you take—even in repair situations—you become someone people want in their lives.

### This Changes How You See Yourself

If you're someone who adds value in every interaction—including when you mess up—you start to like yourself more.

If you've been insecure about what you offer, this gives you something concrete: **You're someone who makes things right in a way that leaves people better off.**

That's rare. That's valuable. That's attractive.

## When the Other Person Doesn't Want Contact

Sometimes the person receiving the repair may:

- Not want communication at all
- Want less than you want to give
- Need space more than words

**Respecting their wishes IS the action.**

Even if it doesn't feel satisfying because you wanted to give more—honoring their boundary is the repair.

## Allowing Repair

If you're the one who was harmed:

- Can you allow the person to make it right?
- Or are you more invested in punishment?
- What would actually help you heal?

Sometimes people want revenge more than repair. That's a choice—but it's not resolution.

## When Repair Isn't Possible

Some harms are too severe. Some people won't take [responsibility](./responsibility.md).

In those cases:

- Match [response to severity](./appropriate-response.md)
- Involve facilitators
- Prioritize your safety
- Don't become a harm-creator yourself
