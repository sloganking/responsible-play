## The Core Principle: Show, Don't Tell

**If there is one principle that governs everything else in this book—one thing to take with you if you take nothing else—it's this:**

> **People don't learn what you teach. They learn what you do.**

Or, put another way:

> **We must become what we wish to teach.**

This is the most important thing to understand as a facilitator. More important than your curriculum. More important than your exercises. More important than anything you say.

Nothing matters more for a facilitator than alignment between what you say and what you do. You can teach about consent, boundaries, and dignity all day. But what people learn is what they see you do when it's hard.

Your actions are louder than your words. Every time.

---

## Words Are Cheap

You can give the most eloquent talk about consent. You can explain the drama triangle beautifully. You can teach RBDSMT and facilitator protocols and appropriate response.

None of it matters if your actions contradict it.

When you're tested—when a participant is angry, when a mob is forming, when you're scared—your actions in that moment teach more than every word you've ever spoken. Your participants are watching. And they're learning from what you *do*, not what you *said*.

| What You Say                    | What You Do                                  | What They Actually Learn         |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| "Everyone deserves respect"     | You let someone disrespect you               | Respect is optional when angry   |
| "Mistakes don't mean leaving"   | You kick someone out under pressure          | Mob pressure wins                |
| "We verify before judging"      | You take action based on one side            | Verification is lip service      |
| "Proportional responses matter" | You let HIGH responses to LOW mistakes slide | Severity doesn't actually matter |
| "You deserve dignity"           | You don't stand up for yourself              | Dignity is just a nice idea      |
| "Take responsibility"           | You blame others when things go wrong        | Responsibility is for others     |

**If your actions contradict your words, your actions are what people remember.**

### The Intimidated Facilitator

Here's a scenario:

You're facilitating a retreat. Participant A makes an honest mistake. Participant B is furious. They start attacking Participant A. They escalate to threats of violence, getting in their face, implying "if you disagree with me, something bad will happen."

You, the facilitator, are scared. Participant B is intimidating. And fears rise in you:

- *"This person is making threats of violence. If I confront them, will they physically attack me?"*
- *"If I stand up to this person—if I enforce my boundary—will they try to destroy my reputation?"*
- *"Will they slander me online? Will they attack my organization?"*

So you find a way to remove Participant A instead—the person who made the mistake. You rationalize it: "Things will be calmer if they leave." Maybe you even say afterward: "This shouldn't have happened. Mistakes are normally protected."

**But what did your actions communicate?**

Here's what every participant in that room just learned:

> "Mistakes are not OK and will not be tolerated. And if you're a participant who makes a mistake, you'll be attacked and asked to leave too."

It doesn't matter what you *said*. It doesn't matter if you apologized later. It doesn't matter if you explained that "normally" this wouldn't happen. Your actions taught the lesson. And the lesson was: **the intimidating person wins. The mistake-maker gets punished. Threats of violence are tolerated and even rewarded. Your promises of protection are worthless when someone scary gets upset.**

Every participant now knows:
- The rules don't actually protect them
- If someone attacks them, the facilitator might side with the attacker
- Intimidation works
- They are not safe here

**This is the opposite of walking your talk.** You removed the person who made an honest mistake—and kept the person making threats. You punished vulnerability and rewarded intimidation. Whether you stated your values publicly or not, your actions taught everyone in the room what you actually stand for.

### This Is Exactly When the Promise Matters

The promise isn't for easy moments. It's for *this* moment—when things are intense, when you're scared, when there's a threatening person in front of you and you're tempted to give in.

This is exactly when the promise becomes useful:

1. **You already know what to do.** There's no questioning, no agonizing over the decision. You stated the rule. Threats of violence mean removal. The path is clear.

2. **Everyone else knows what's okay and what's not.** You announced it publicly. Every participant can see: "This behavior violates our agreements." Including the person violating them.

3. **It protects you from being tempted to act out of fear.** If you give in to Participant B, you're not just making a bad judgment call—you're violating your own word. You're breaking a promise you made to everyone in the room. The promise raises the stakes on betraying your values.

**This can happen whether you made a promise or not.** If you made the promise and cave, you've broken your word publicly. If you never made a promise, you're even more vulnerable—because there's nothing anchoring you when the pressure hits.

Without the promise, you're in a fog. You don't know what you're supposed to do. You didn't commit to anything publicly. It's easy to rationalize giving in—"Maybe I'm overreacting. Maybe this isn't that serious."

And it's not just you who's in a fog—your participants are too.

Without clear rules stated upfront, participants are genuinely confused about what should happen. They're coming in with all kinds of preconceived cultural notions about what happens when someone makes a mistake—especially in areas of sexuality. And humans tend to mirror the emotions of those around them (see: [People Mirror Emotions, Not Facts](#people-mirror-emotions-not-facts)). When Participant B is angry and upset and acting like Participant A did something terrible, other participants are going to absorb that framing. There's nothing to counteract it. No pre-established agreement that says "actually, mistakes are protected here."

Maybe you, the facilitator, privately knew your boundaries. Maybe you had a "silent promise"—you knew you'd remove people who made threats of violence. But you never announced it.

Now when you try to enforce that boundary—when you tell Participant B they can't threaten people here—the other participants don't see a facilitator upholding agreed-upon rules. They see you taking a personal stand. Moralizing. Making a judgment call. Because from their perspective, there were no rules. You never told them. So your enforcement looks like an opinion, not a boundary.

With the promise, the fog clears. Participant B is doing exactly what you said would result in removal. Your job is obvious. The only question is: will you do it?

**The promise benefits you as much as it benefits participants.** It gives you clarity when you're scared. It gives you something to point to when you're being pressured. It stops you from not knowing what to do and being tempted to cave.

The correct response was clear: Participant B, who escalated to threats and intimidation, should have been given a boundary and—if they continued—removed. That's what your rules say. That's what you promised.

But if you were scared—if fear made you betray everything you claimed to stand for—then you've shown everyone that your word means nothing when it costs you something.

**This is why embodiment matters more than curriculum.** Anyone can write good rules. The question is: will you enforce them when the scary person is looking at you?

## Your Body Teaches Too

It's not just your actions. Your **body** teaches.

When someone is attacking you or another participant, your animal body is communicating constantly:

- Are you calm or panicked?
- Are you grounded or reactive?
- Does your energy say "this is an emergency" or "this will be handled"?
- Does your posture say "I'm confident in my values" or "I'm unsure if I deserve to be here"?

Your participants are reading your nervous system. They're mirroring your emotional state. Your body is teaching them how to feel about what's happening—whether you intend it to or not.

### People Mirror Emotions, Not Facts

Here's something most facilitators don't realize: **people don't primarily look at facts to determine how they should feel. They mirror the emotions of others.**

This is animal-level communication. Our bodies read other bodies. Words tell you what to think. Emotions tell you how to feel about it.

**Example: A boundary violation occurs.**

Person A apologizes—it was an unconscious mistake.

**If Person B is calm and understanding:**
- Their body language says "this is okay, we're handling it"
- The audience mirrors that calm
- The room stays grounded
- Person A is seen as someone who made a mistake

**If Person B (or a rescuer) freaks out:**
- Crying, screaming "predator," maximum intensity
- The audience mirrors that intensity
- Even if they didn't witness what happened
- Even if they have no idea what actually occurred
- They assume the anger is justified and feel it too
- Person A is seen as a threat

The audience isn't evaluating the facts. They're reading the emotional intensity and concluding: "If someone is THIS upset, something terrible must have happened."

This is how witch hunts form. Not from evidence—from emotional contagion.

### You Are the Emotional Anchor

As facilitator, **you are the emotional anchor for the room.**

People look to you. If you're calm, they're more likely to be calm. If you panic, they panic. Your animal body sets the reference point for everyone else's nervous system.

**If there's a dispute and one person is extremely over-the-top angry:**
- Don't match their energy
- Stay grounded in your body
- Treat the accused with dignity and respect
- Acknowledge the angry person's emotions without getting swept up in them
- Your calm communicates: "This will be handled. This is not an emergency."

**What participants will take from your calm:**
- "The facilitator isn't panicking, so maybe this isn't as catastrophic as Person B is making it seem"
- "The facilitator is treating Person A with respect, so maybe Person A isn't a monster"
- "Maybe Person B's emotional intensity is disproportionate to what actually happened"

Your nervous system regulation becomes permission for others to regulate too.

### The Trap: The Angriest Person Sets the Tone

The trap is this: **the angriest person often sets the emotional tone.**

If you're not conscious of this dynamic, you'll find yourself—and the whole room—swept up in someone's over-response. Their intensity hijacks the container. Their emotions become the room's emotions. And suddenly everyone is treating a MEDIUM mistake like HIGH severity, because the emotional volume convinced them.

Your job is to be the counterweight. Not dismissive—you acknowledge their pain. But not swept away either. Your grounded presence gives everyone else permission to stay grounded too.

### This Is a Skill

Staying calm when someone is screaming at you (or at someone else) is not easy. It requires:

- Nervous system regulation practice
- Not taking their emotional state personally
- Trusting that you can handle what's happening
- Remembering that their intensity is data about them, not about reality

If you can hold your center while chaos swirls, you've just given the entire room a gift. You've prevented the emotional contagion from turning into a mob.

## Create an Informed Container

Here's something facilitators often miss:

**Before emotions are expressed publicly, make sure your audience knows what actually happened.**

Human nature is to believe things based on feelings, not facts. When your participants see someone angry and someone apologizing, they don't analyze the data. They assume: "If someone is THIS upset, something terrible must have happened." And they form judgments accordingly—without ever knowing what occurred.

This is how witch hunts start.

### How This Pattern Plays Out

Imagine this scenario—it happens more often than you'd think:

Someone makes a MEDIUM mistake. The person affected talks to them about it. They work it out. The affected person feels complete. Issue resolved.

But the affected person's partner hears about it. They weren't there. They didn't witness anything. They just heard about it secondhand—and they're furious. They step into [Rescuer](./drama-triangle.md) mode.

Now the facilitators set up an exercise where the Rescuer and the mistake-maker can process. Emotions run high. The Rescuer is attacking with maximum intensity. The mistake-maker is apologizing, trying to de-escalate.

**What the audience sees:** Someone very angry. Someone apologizing.

**What the audience concludes:** The mistake must have been severe. The angry person must be justified. The apologizer must be guilty of something terrible.

**What actually happened:** A MEDIUM mistake that had already been resolved with the actual person involved—who isn't even upset anymore.

But no one tells the audience this. No one shares what actually occurred. No one gets primary source accounts before the emotional display. So the audience forms a mob mentality based on emotional intensity rather than facts.

Later, if anyone finds out what actually happened, the response is consistent: "That's it? I thought it was something much worse based on how angry that person was."

But most of the group never learns. They only have the emotional intensity to judge by. And the witch hunt has already begun.

### What Should Have Happened

Before the emotional exercise, the facilitator should have said:

> "Before we do this, let's hear from the people who were actually involved. Person A, Person B—can you each share your perspective on what happened?"

Even better:

> "Person B, you and Person A talked last night. How do you feel about it now? Is this resolved for you?"

If Person B had said, "Yeah, I feel complete. We worked it out. I don't hold anything against them"—then everyone would have seen the Rescuer's rage for what it was: an over-response driven by their own stories, not by the actual severity of what occurred.

The audience would have had context. Most would have seen: the person who was actually wronged isn't even upset. This angry person is representing their own emotions, not the victim's. This is a [Rescuer](./drama-triangle.md) dynamic, not justified outrage.

Not everyone—some people will still view things through their own trauma filters and side with intensity regardless of facts. But the *majority* would recognize this as an over-response. And that's what matters. Mobs form when the whole room gets swept up. When most people have context and can see clearly, the groupthink works *for* truth instead of against it.

The witch hunt wouldn't have formed.

### Your Duty as Facilitator

**You are in the prime position to guide your container toward truth.**

Human nature will lead people to:
- Believe things based on emotional intensity rather than facts
- Form judgments before they have information
- Mirror the angriest person in the room
- Spread rumors and unverified beliefs

You can't change human nature. But you can work with it.

If you take steps to ensure your audience is always informed—always has context, always hears from primary sources before judgments form—then your container will operate more from truth. There will be fewer witch hunts. Fewer mob dynamics. Fewer people destroyed by over-responses to MEDIUM mistakes.

**Practical steps:**

1. Before emotional processing happens publicly, get the facts on the table
2. Have primary sources share their perspectives—both of them
3. Check: Is the person who was wronged still upset? Or has this been resolved?
4. Name when someone isn't a primary source: "You weren't there—you're responding to what you heard, not what you witnessed"
5. Give the audience context before they form conclusions

**If you don't do this, you're responsible for the witch hunt that follows.**

Not because you caused it directly. But because you had the power to prevent it and didn't use it. Everyone in the room could have spoken up—but you, as facilitator, were in the best position to guide things toward truth. That's your job.

### When Someone Has Already Formed a Conclusion

Sometimes you're too late. Someone has already formed a story and is treating it as fact.

Here's what you can do:

**Prompt them to consider alternatives.** People's brains latch onto the first plausible explanation and stop looking. Your job is to gently reopen the search.

> "That's one story about what happened. What are some other explanations that could fit the same facts?"

> "Did you use [Notice, Feel, Story](../tools/notice-feel-story.md)? What did you actually observe versus what you interpreted?"

> "If a participant had done the exact same thing, would you have assumed the same intent?"

**Name the pattern when you see it.** When someone has jumped to a conclusion without checking, you can point it out:

> "I notice you've formed a conclusion about their intent. Did you verify that with them? Or is that your story about what happened?"

> "It sounds like you're treating your interpretation as fact. Have you considered that something else might explain what you saw?"

This isn't about invalidating their feelings. Their feelings are real. But their story might be wrong—and if they act on a wrong story with HIGH severity, real harm gets done.

Your role is to slow things down enough for truth to have a chance.

## Conflict Is Your Greatest Teaching Moment

Here's the reframe that changes everything:

**When something goes wrong in your container, it's not a problem. It's an opportunity to teach more powerfully than you ever could when things are calm.**

During your exercises and talks, you're *telling* lessons. When someone's angry, when someone's attacking you or another participant, when chaos erupts—suddenly you're *showing* the lesson. And that's what sticks.

Your participants will forget most of what you said during the comfortable parts. They will remember forever how you handled the hard parts.

- The moment someone attacked you and you held your ground with dignity
- The moment a mob was forming and you stayed calm
- The moment someone was being treated unfairly and you protected them
- The moment you could have fawned and you didn't

These become the lessons they carry into their lives. Not your slides. Not your exercises. Your actions in the moments that mattered.

**So when things go awry, don't see it as failure. See it as the moment your real curriculum begins.**

---

## The Gap Between Knowing and Being

Many facilitators *know* these principles. They can articulate them perfectly. But there's a gap between knowing and being.

When you're tested:
- Do you *become* what you teach?
- Or do you revert to old patterns while your words echo uselessly in everyone's memory?

This is why the hardest work for facilitators isn't learning the material. It's **embodying** it so deeply that you don't have to think about it when things get hard. It just *is* who you are.

### The Ultimate Standard

Here's the bar to hold yourself to:

> **If I had no words—if I could only be observed—would my actions teach the principles I claim to believe?**

If yes, you're walking your talk.

If no, your words are just noise. And your participants will learn from your actions instead.

### When the Facilitator Fawns

Here's the worst version of this gap:

**A facilitator who knows the truth but doesn't speak it out of fear.**

I've seen this happen. Facilitators—and sometimes their staff—who believed something should be handled one way, but were afraid. Afraid of confrontation. Afraid of backlash. Afraid of losing participants or reputation. So they acted out the *opposite* of what they believed should be done.

They didn't tell their truth about how things should be handled. They *showed* everyone the opposite.

The damage cascades:

**Participants learn the wrong lesson.** They watched how the facilitator handled the situation and assumed *that's how it should be handled.* They left the retreat with their harmful beliefs reinforced—beliefs the facilitator knew were wrong but was too afraid to challenge.

**Participants were deprived of clarity.** The facilitator had an opportunity to show them a hard truth. A truth that didn't fit their comfortable story. A truth that, if they'd actually received it, would have let them take a hard look at their assumptions—and might have been the singular life-changing lesson of that retreat.

**The harm propagates.** Those participants go home with their [Rescuer beliefs](./why-rescuers-are-dangerous.md) intact. They continue causing harm to everyone around them. They pass the beliefs to others. All because one person—the person in the room with the most influence—was too afraid to show them something different.

When a participant [fawns](./fawning.md), they harm themselves and maybe one other person. When a facilitator fawns, they fail every participant who was looking to them for clarity. It's a force multiplier.

**You are the person in the room with the most influence.** Participants—and even your staff—are impressionable. They look to you for clarity about what's true and how things should be handled. They form their own beliefs based on what you *show*, regardless of what you tell or don't tell.

Are you going to be the reason your participants see clearly from this day forward? The reason they become a value-adding presence to everyone they interact with?

Or are you going to be part of the reason they stay stuck in a false story—one that brings continuing suffering to them and everyone around them?

Most people act from fear. Most people aren't clear-seeing enough to know what should be done. But you can be the one who shows them something they can never forget. In a way that possibly only you can.

**Your job is to serve your participants, not to please them.** Pleasing is fawning. Serving is telling the truth even when it's uncomfortable.

---

## This Is Your Integrity

Walking your talk is the most important thing as a facilitator.

Not your curriculum. Not your marketing. Not your reputation. Not how many retreats you've led or trainings you've completed.

**Your integrity.**

The alignment between what you say and what you do. The alignment between what you teach and who you are.

That's what participants actually learn from. That's what changes their lives. That's what makes you worth following.

---

## Your First Officer

> **"Every good captain needs a first officer who will tell him when he's wrong."**  
> — _Star Trek: Strange New Worlds_ ([clip](https://photos.app.goo.gl/B8xWSpnxTAubvVi78))

As a facilitator, you need people around you who will tell you when you're wrong.

Not yes-men who agree with everything you say. Not people who are afraid to challenge you. You need co-facilitators, assistants, or trusted participants who:

- Have sound judgment you trust
- Will speak up when they see you making a mistake
- Can do it respectfully, without undermining your authority
- Will defer to your final decision even if they disagree

**This is extremely important.** You're human. You have blind spots. You'll make calls in the heat of the moment that aren't right. You need someone who can say: "Hey, I think you might be off here. Have you considered...?"

### How to Find Your First Officer

Look for people who:

- Have wisdom from lived experience (not just opinions)
- Can disagree without being disagreeable
- Understand the difference between input and authority
- Will support your decision publicly even if they challenged it privately

### For Participants: You May Be That Person

If you've been through significant experiences, introspected deeply, and gained real wisdom—you may have perspective that even experienced facilitators lack.

Don't assume they've seen everything. They haven't. Your experience and insight can guide them toward better outcomes. Offer it respectfully. You're not just a participant—you're a potential resource.
