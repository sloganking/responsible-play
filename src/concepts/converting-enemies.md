# Converting Enemies

## The Default Response

When someone attacks you—when they're coming at you with accusations, anger, or harmful intent—the instinct is to fight back. Defend yourself. Attack their credibility. Mobilize allies against them.

Sometimes that's exactly the right move.

There's a saying in [Target Focus Training](https://targetfocustraining.com/)—a reality-based self-protection program:

> **"Violence is rarely the answer—until it is the only answer."**

If Inquisitors are knocking down your door, fighting back may be exactly what the situation requires. When someone is actively attacking you and there's no other option, self-defense isn't just justified—it's necessary.

But here's the thing:

**Nine times out of ten, when you think violence is inevitable—when you think you have no choice—you're deluding yourself.**

There's usually a path you're not seeing. A way to de-escalate, to reframe, to find common ground. The certainty that "I have no choice but to fight" is often just a failure of imagination—or a story your fear is telling you.

The moments when violence is truly the only answer are rarer than they feel.

Here's what changes when you step back and see the pattern clearly.

## The Recognition

In many cases—like the Crusades, the Inquisition, the witch trials—those people were real predators _in effect_. They tortured and murdered people for crimes as simple as believing something different than they did. The harm they caused was extreme and real.

And yet.

**These people who seem like threats are usually good people operating on harmful, false beliefs.**

Not evil. Not irredeemable. Confused. Scared. Certain they're protecting something important. Operating on a model of reality that happens to be wrong—and that wrong model is driving them to cause harm.

When you have that recognition, something shifts.

---

## The Strategic Insight

If the problem were that these people are _evil_—genuinely malicious, consciously choosing to cause harm for its own sake—then communication would be pointless. You'd have no choice but to fight or flee.

But that's rarely the problem.

**The real problem is usually a communication problem.**

They don't see what you see. They don't understand what you understand. Their beliefs are filtering reality in a way that makes their harmful actions seem necessary and good.

When you recognize this, the optimal strategy changes. As long as the option is possible, it's better to work toward understanding—because you're not dealing with evil people who can't be reasoned with. You're dealing with confused people who _could_ be reached.

Communication becomes the superior strategy. Not because it's morally better (though it might be). Because it's _strategically_ better.

---

## They're Not Stupid

Here's the cop-out most people take:

"They're just dumb."
"They're incapable of seeing clearly."
"They can't think at my level."
"They're too far gone."

This is an excuse to give up. It lets you off the hook from having to figure out how to actually reach them.

**If they can't see through their story, you haven't communicated well enough.**

That's not an insult to you—it's an invitation. It means the problem is solvable. It means there's a way to frame things, a way to show them, a way to connect that would actually land. You just haven't found it yet.

The person in front of you has reasons for what they're doing. Based on their beliefs about the situation—about the world, about you, about what's at stake—everything they're doing makes sense. Their actions are sane and reasonable _given their model of reality_.

> **"All people's actions are sane and reasonable, given their beliefs about the world they are operating within."**

Even acts that look purely selfish often come from something deeper. Someone hoarding resources, stepping on others to get ahead, refusing to cooperate—that's often not malice. It's a belief in scarcity. A belief that there's not enough to go around. That we can't all win. That it's you or me.

That belief is a lie. But they don't know it's a lie. They're acting rationally within a false model.

Calling them stupid or evil is easier than doing the hard work of understanding their world well enough to show them a different one. It's a cop-out dressed up as insight.

The real question isn't "why are they so dumb?" It's: "What would I need to show them for them to see what I see?"

## Show, Don't Tell

Here's where most people fail:

They try to _tell_ the other person that cooperation is better than fighting.

"It's better if we work together."
"We're on the same side."
"You're misunderstanding me."

This doesn't work. If you tell them it's better to cooperate, but you don't _show_ them how—they don't believe you. You haven't actually communicated anything.

**Real communication means demonstrating—not declaring.**

You have to show them that working together in a way that's prosperous for you both is better and more desired _by them_ than fighting is.

How do you do that? By understanding what they actually want. By finding the outcome where both of you win. By making it viscerally clear that you're not their enemy—that fighting you costs them something they care about, and cooperating with you gets them something they want.

If you can actually communicate this—show, not tell—they'll put down their weapons. They'll work in ways that benefit you both.

You might even become allies.

## Don't Moralize

Some people try a different approach: tell the person what they're doing is _wrong_. Appeal to their desire to be good. Shame them into changing.

> **"No one was ever made good by being told he or she was bad."**  
> — _Nathaniel Branden, The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem_

Moralizing fails for several reasons:

**It skips understanding.** When you moralize, you're not figuring out _why_ the person is doing what they're doing. You're not addressing the concerns, fears, or beliefs that led to the behavior. You're just slapping a label on it and demanding they stop.

**It's just blame with extra steps.** Moralizing is shame dressed up as guidance. You're trying to narratively domesticate someone—make them compliant through guilt rather than through genuine understanding.

**It often doesn't work.** Some people are susceptible to shaming. Many aren't. And even when it "works," you've created obedience, not transformation. They're avoiding punishment, not pursuing something they actually want.

**It disempowers them.** If you actually care about the person in front of you, think about what motivation you're giving them. Fear, shame, and guilt are push motivations—running _away_ from something bad. They're weaker, less sustainable, and they leave people feeling small.

Inspiration is pull motivation—running _toward_ something good. It's stronger, it lasts, and it leaves people feeling capable.

> A teacher can think about rules in one of two ways. She can wonder "How can I _make_ students do what needs to be done?" Or she can wonder "How can I _inspire_ students to _want_ to do what needs to be done?"
>
> The first orientation is adversarial and achieves obedience while encouraging dependency. The second is benevolent and achieves cooperation while encouraging self-responsibility.
>
> — _Nathaniel Branden, The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem_

If you want someone to change, don't tell them they're bad for not changing. Show them why they'd _want_ to change. Make the alternative so compelling that choosing it feels like winning.

That's not manipulation. That's respect—treating them as a capable person who can choose, rather than a child who must be shamed into compliance.

## The Deepest Win

There's a level beyond getting someone to cooperate:

**Help them see out of the delusion itself.**

If you can communicate so clearly that they recognize their limiting beliefs—the ones that were driving them to cause harm—something profound happens. They step back. They have empathy. They see that what they've been doing is not actually creating what they want in the world.

When that happens, you've done more than neutralize a threat. You've helped someone escape a belief that was causing them so much pain, so much fear, that it was driving them to drastic action to protect themselves.

And here's the bonus:

**Someone who escapes a limiting belief usually wants to help others escape it too.**

They know what it feels like to be trapped in that thinking. They know the suffering it caused—to themselves and others. And now that they're out, they often want to help their friends get out of the same limiting, harmful beliefs.

An enemy becomes an advocate. One conversion creates more conversions.

## When This Works

This approach works when:

- **The person is reachable.** They're not so activated that they literally cannot hear you.
- **You have time and space.** They're not actively knocking down your door right now.
- **You can find common ground.** There's some outcome you both want, even if you disagree on how to get there.
- **You're willing to understand their world.** Not agree with it—understand it. See why their actions make sense _given their beliefs_.

---

## When This Doesn't Work

Sometimes fighting _is_ the only answer.

- **Immediate physical threat.** If you're in danger right now, your priority is safety, not conversion.
- **Someone who won't engage.** Some people aren't ready or willing to hear anything. You can't force understanding.
- **Bad faith.** If they're genuinely malicious—consciously choosing harm for its own sake—communication won't help. (But remember: this is far rarer than it seems. [Most "predators" are confused, not evil](./before-you-judge.md#most-people-arent-predators).)
- **Power imbalance too extreme.** If they hold all the cards and have no incentive to listen, you may need to change your position before communication becomes viable.

The point isn't that communication always works. The point is that _when it's possible_, it's the highest-leverage move available.

---

## The Invitation

Next time you're facing someone caught in a harmful belief—someone who seems like a threat, an enemy, a persecutor—pause before you fight.

Ask yourself:

- Is this person evil, or confused?
- What do they believe that's making their actions seem necessary?
- What would they need to _see_ (not hear) to put down their weapons?
- Is there a world where we both win?

If the answers suggest a path forward, take it. Not because fighting is wrong—sometimes it's right. But because converting an enemy into an ally is almost always better than defeating them.

And if you can help them see out of the delusion entirely?

You don't just gain an ally. You gain an advocate who will help others escape the same trap.

That's the deepest win.
