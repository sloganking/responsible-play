# Before You Facilitate

## Why Read This If You're Not a Facilitator

You don't have to run events to benefit from understanding how good containers work.

If you know what responsible facilitation looks like, you can:

- **Recognize when a container isn't being held well**—when safety protocols are missing, when incidents are being handled poorly, when the facilitator is [fawning](#when-the-facilitator-fawns) instead of leading. That awareness lets you navigate with more care, protect yourself, or choose not to return.
- **Speak up when something's off.** You're not a passive consumer. If you see something that should be handled differently, having the language and framework to name it gives you the power to create change—even as a participant.
- **Be part of the solution.** The best containers aren't held by facilitators alone. They're held by participants who take [responsibility](./responsibility.md), who understand the dynamics, who add value instead of just consuming the experience.

Knowing how things *should* work makes you a better participant everywhere you go.

## A Note on Context

Not all facilitation looks the same. There's a spectrum:

- A **seven-day transformation retreat** where deep work happens and you're guiding people through life-changing experiences
- A **weekend workshop** mixing education with exploration
- A **one-night play party** where you're primarily holding safety
- A **casual gathering** with minimal structure and a loose host

This page is written for the deep end—because that's where the stakes are highest and the principles matter most. But the core ideas scale down. Even a casual host benefits from understanding [Rescuer dynamics](./why-rescuers-are-dangerous.md), [proportional response](./appropriate-response.md), and not [fawning](./fawning.md) when things get uncomfortable.

Take what's relevant to your context. The deeper the container you hold, the more of this applies.

---

## A Note on Severity

Facilitating sex-positive events is **higher severity** than most other facilitation work.

The stakes are higher. The mistakes are more costly. The dynamics are more complex. The potential for harm—and the potential for profound healing—are both amplified.

This means that having the concepts in this book deeply understood and embodied isn't optional. Whether you learn them here or elsewhere, having these principles figured out will be **imperative to your continued happiness and success** as a facilitator.

If you're facilitating in intimate spaces without this foundation, you're playing minesweeper without knowing where the mines are.

## Staff Readiness: Feed Yourself First

Here's something most facilitators don't talk about:

**If you're sexually starved, you're a liability.**

Think about it like a hungry dog at a buffet. A well-fed dog can walk past food without grabbing. A starving dog cannot. Its animal body takes over. Impulse overwhelms judgment.

The same applies to facilitators and staff at sex-positive events. If you haven't been sexually satisfied—if you're running on empty, touch-starved, desperate for connection—your animal body is hungry. And hungry animal bodies make mistakes.

### The Mechanism

When you're sexually fed:

- Your conscious mind has more control
- You can be around intimacy without your body screaming for it
- You make clearer decisions
- Your presence is calmer, more grounded

When you're sexually starved:

- Your animal body has more control
- Your subconscious is scanning for opportunities
- You're more likely to miss cues, push boundaries unconsciously, or make mistakes you wouldn't make if you were satisfied
- You're a hungry dog at a buffet

This isn't about willpower or character. It's about state. A starved body behaves differently than a fed one.

### The Facilitator Standard

If you're facilitating sex-positive spaces, consider this a form of professional hygiene:

**Take care of your sexual needs before you facilitate.**

This might mean:

- Having a partner who meets your needs
- Attending parties for your own pleasure (separate from work)
- Working with a sex worker
- Finding regular outlets for intimacy and connection

If you're leading a week-long retreat, make sure you're not arriving sexually starved. If you're running a play party, make sure your own needs have been met recently.

### For Your Staff

If you have staff or assistants, consider their state too.

A team of sexually starved people facilitating a sex party is a team of hungry dogs managing a buffet. The risk of mistakes—unconscious boundary crossings, moments where the animal body takes over—goes up dramatically.

**A recommendation:** Consider making this a hard boundary for your staff.

Not "encourage self-care." Not "create a culture." A requirement: *You cannot work my events unless you've been sexually satisfied recently.*

Think of it like meals at a retreat. If something went wrong and meals had been delayed—if nobody had eaten in 24 hours—you wouldn't push forward with the curriculum. You'd stop. You'd make sure everyone was fed before continuing. Because hungry people can't show up fully. Their bodies are distracted by unmet needs.

Sexual hunger works the same way. If your staff haven't been fed, they're not ready to serve.

### The Jumpmaster Reframe

There's a video of military paratroopers jumping from a plane. Before each jump, a jumpmaster does a final check—gear, straps, everything. In the video, someone is about to jump. Split second from the door. And the jumpmaster sees it: the static line is wrapped around the jumper's neck. If he jumps, he's decapitated.

The jumpmaster grabs him. Shoves him back. Saves his life.

That pre-check isn't bureaucracy. It's love.

**Here's the reframe:**

When I require my staff to be sexually satisfied before working my events, I'm not just protecting participants. I'm not just protecting myself. I'm protecting *them*.

I'm the jumpmaster. I'm catching something that could hurt them before they jump.

If you're sexually starved and you make an unconscious mistake—like I did—you don't just harm the participant. You harm yourself. Your reputation. Your standing in the community. Your self-image. You have to live with what your hungry animal body did while you weren't fully in control.

By saying "you can't work here until you're fed," I'm saying: *Go take care of yourself. I won't let you jump with a rope around your neck.*

### What This Is Actually About

Someone might read this and think: "What, are your staff predators? People who will consciously violate boundaries if they're hungry?"

No. That's not the concern.

This isn't about morality. It's about accounting for human nature. It's not designed to dissuade people from committing intentional harm. I expect and take steps to ensure my staff are completely consciously aligned—good people who would never choose to cross a boundary.

The concern is **unconscious harm.**

Like the [popcorn metaphor](../tools/popcorn-metaphor.md). Like my personal example. Mistakes that aren't choices. Moments where the conscious mind slips and the animal body does something the person would never consciously do.

Even if you're completely aligned consciously, your unconscious has wants and desires. If those wants are starving, they have more pull. They're closer to the surface. And when your conscious mind dips—even for a second—the hungry unconscious is more likely to act.

This rule isn't about stopping predators. It's about reducing micro-mistakes from good people whose animal bodies aren't fed. It's about making sure everyone's unconscious is as aligned and safe as possible—so that even when attention slips, the autopilot doesn't cause harm.

### If They Don't Understand

A newbie might hear this boundary and feel excluded. "Why can't I assist at the party? Are you stopping me from having sex? From bonding with the staff team? I feel left out."

They might not understand yet.

But saying no here is an act of love. It's looking out for them in two ways:

1. **Stopping them from endangering themselves** — preventing the unconscious mistake that could damage their life
2. **Requiring they take care of themselves** — the boundary isn't "you can't participate." The boundary is "go get fed first."

Not all facilitators will do this. It's a high bar. But I'm considering it for my events—because if there's an obvious source of unsafety I can prevent, I want to prevent it.

### This Is Taking Responsibility

This isn't indulgence. It's [responsibility](./responsibility.md).

You're in a position where your state affects others. Taking care of yourself—including sexually—reduces the risk you pose to participants. It's the same logic as getting enough sleep, not drinking before facilitating, and managing your emotional state.

Feed yourself first. Then you can hold space for others without your hunger getting in the way.

### Don't Watch Horror Before Temple

Here's another form of professional hygiene that sounds like satire:

**If my staff are consuming predator-hunting content right before working my events, they don't get to work.**

This means: no horror films, no true crime binges, no doom-scrolling through callout posts, no consent-violation discourse—right before showing up to hold space.

Why? Because of the [horror movie effect](./trauma-and-filters.md#dont-watch-horror-before-temple). If you spend hours priming your RAS to scan for threats, you're going to walk into a room full of friends and see predators everywhere. Every ambiguous touch becomes suspicious. Every awkward moment becomes evidence. You're setting yourself up to see shit that isn't real—and then react to it.

This sounds unbelievable. It sounds like a joke. "You can't be staff if you watched a horror movie?" But that's exactly the level of sensitivity we're operating at. The number of unconscious filters running your perception is immense. If you're filling your head with monsters before entering an intimate space, you are not in a state to hold it safely.

The same logic applies: you wouldn't let someone work your event if they hadn't slept, if they were drunk, if they were sexually starved. Mental state matters too. Filter state matters. What you consume affects what you perceive—and what you perceive affects what you do.

This is the jumpmaster check for your staff's filters. Don't let them jump with their RAS primed for predators.

### Pre-Framing: The Flip Side

What you just read is pre-framing — your filter gets set before you walk into the room. Horror content pre-frames your staff to see threats. But the same mechanism works in the positive direction.

When you open your container by telling everyone "people here are learning, mistakes are expected, and when something goes wrong we repair with love — everyone around you is your friend," you're pre-framing every participant's filter. You're setting their RAS to interpret ambiguous moments as learning rather than threats.

This matters because the first frame applied to a situation tends to stick. If someone's filter is already set to "safe learning environment where mistakes are expected," then when a boundary gets crossed, their first interpretation is "that was a mistake, let's repair." If their filter was never set — or worse, was set by scrolling through callout posts before arriving — their first interpretation might be "predator." And once that label lands, it's nearly impossible to dislodge. The group's perception crystallizes around it.

Your opening remarks aren't a formality. They're inoculation — you're installing the group's immune system before anyone gets sick.

## Will You Play With Participants?

One of the first decisions you need to make as a facilitator is whether you will engage in intimate or sexual play with participants in your container.

Some facilitators choose not to. Others choose to participate fully. Both are valid choices—but each comes with tradeoffs you need to understand.

### If You Choose NOT to Play

**Pros:**
- Cleaner power dynamics—no questions about whether your authority influenced a participant's consent
- Easier to stay objective when conflicts arise
- Less personal risk of being involved in a mistake or accusation
- You can focus entirely on holding the container

**Cons:**
- May feel disconnected from what participants are experiencing
- Less experiential understanding of the vulnerabilities involved
- Some participants may perceive you as outside the experience rather than part of it

### If You Choose TO Play

**Pros:**
- Deeper connection with participants—you're in it together
- Leading by example—showing how to navigate these spaces, not just telling
- Direct understanding of participant experience and vulnerabilities
- Can model good behavior in real-time

**Cons:**
- Power dynamics become more complex—did they say yes because they wanted to, or because you're the authority figure?
- You will eventually make mistakes or have mistakes made against you
- You are now subject to over-responses, accusations, and the same dynamics you're trying to manage
- Harder to stay objective when you're personally involved in conflicts

### The Acceptance

If you choose to play with participants, **you must accept that mistakes and over-responses will eventually occur.**

This isn't a possibility—it's a certainty. Play long enough and:
- You will cross someone's boundary accidentally
- Someone will cross yours
- Someone will over-respond to a mistake you made
- You'll have to navigate being both facilitator and participant in a conflict

This isn't a reason not to play. But it IS something you must go in with eyes open about. If you're not prepared to handle being on the receiving end of the dynamics this book describes, you're not ready to be a facilitator who plays.

### No Judgment Either Way

Neither choice is "right." What matters is:
1. You make the choice consciously
2. You understand the tradeoffs
3. You're prepared for the consequences of your choice

Some of the best facilitators never touch a participant. Some of the best facilitators are fully in the mix. What they have in common is clarity about their choice and how to handle what comes with it.

## The Promise

One of the most powerful things a facilitator can do is establish clear rules at the beginning of a container—and make an explicit promise:

> **As long as you follow these rules, you are safe. You will not be kicked out. You will not be punished. You have room to experiment, make mistakes, and learn. I have your back.**

This principle shows up in any high-performance environment: when people know exactly what the boundaries are, and know they're protected as long as they stay within them, they can relax. They can take risks. They can fail and learn without fear.

### This Applies to Staff Too

The promise isn't just for participants. Your staff need it too.

At events where staff play with participants, mistakes can occur between them—just like between any two people. Staff should have clear boundaries about what happens when mistakes occur, so they're not operating in fear either.

You can:

- **Use the same promise for everyone** — participants and staff operate under identical rules
- **Modify the promise for staff** — perhaps staff have additional responsibilities, or slightly different expectations given their role

Either way, make it explicit. Staff who don't know where they stand will fawn, over-function, or hold back in ways that don't serve the container.

### Why This Matters

Without clear rules, participants are anxious:

- "What if I do something wrong?"
- "What if someone gets upset with me?"
- "What if I make a mistake and get kicked out?"
- "What counts as 'too far'?"

This anxiety creates fawning, over-caution, and inauthentic participation. People can't fully show up if they're afraid of invisible tripwires.

With clear rules, participants feel contained:

- "I know what's expected of me"
- "I know what will get me in trouble"
- "I know that mistakes are okay"
- "I know the facilitator has my back if I'm operating in good faith"

### Suggested Guidelines

Here's a starter set of rules you might adapt for your container:

**You are safe as long as you:**

1. **Operate in good faith** — You're trying to do right by others, even when you make mistakes
2. **Communicate honestly** — You don't deliberately deceive or manipulate
3. **Respect stated boundaries** — When someone says no or stop, you stop
4. **Check in when uncertain** — If you're not sure, you ask
5. **Take responsibility for your mistakes** — When something goes wrong, you own your part
6. **Treat others with dignity** — Even in conflict, you don't attack character or threaten

**Mistakes are expected and okay:**

- Accidental boundary crossings (unconscious, unintentional)
- Miscommunications
- Getting triggered and needing to step away
- Trying something that doesn't work
- Not knowing something you "should" know

**These will result in being asked to leave:**

1. **Threats or acts of physical violence** — Verbal, physical, or implied. This includes intimidation through body language—walking up to someone aggressively, getting in their face, making them fear you might assault them. You don't have to say "I will punch you" for it to count. Interpretation is up to the facilitators and is not up for debate. Non-negotiable. (See: [Threats of Violence Must Be Stopped Immediately](#threats-of-violence-must-be-stopped-immediately))
2. **Intentional malice** — Deliberately trying to harm someone. If you're intentionally malicious, you're out. Not because of judgment, but because we can't risk escalation.
3. **Repeated boundary violations after being told** — One mistake is human. Continued violation after clear communication is a pattern.
4. **Using victim status as an excuse to attack** — Whether it's your own victimhood or someone else's you're "protecting," victim status is not a license to attack. Defense is acceptable; aggression disguised as defense is not. (See: [Power Dynamics](./power-dynamics.md))
5. **Character assassination and triangulation** — Overt attempts to destroy someone's reputation or mobilize others against them. If you're trying to get people to gang up on someone rather than resolving the issue directly, you've crossed from defense into aggression.

### Defense vs. Aggression

When something goes wrong—a boundary violation, an unwanted touch, a miscommunication—you have rights:

**Defensive actions are always acceptable:**

- Removing yourself from the situation
- Separating someone you care about from harm
- Saying "stop" or "no" firmly
- Having strong emotions
- Taking space to process
- Reporting to facilitators

These are protective. They create safety.

**Aggressive actions are not acceptable:**

- Using the incident as an excuse to publicly attack their character
- Mobilizing others against them before verification
- Responding to a MEDIUM severity infraction with HIGH severity action—that's attack, not defense
- Calling your aggression "defense" when you're really indulging your anger

Here's the key: **Defense protects. Aggression punishes.**

### Your Rights Regarding Removal

**You DO have the right to:**

- Ask the facilitators to enforce our stated agreements
- Request that we review whether someone has violated a removal-worthy rule
- Expect us to act if someone has genuinely crossed those lines

In fact, we welcome it. We invite you to help us walk our talk and maintain our integrity. If you see us failing to uphold our own agreements, tell us. Be an ally in keeping this container safe. We want that partnership.

**You do NOT have the right to:**

- Demand that someone leave if they haven't violated the stated rules
- Pressure facilitators to remove someone based on your anger rather than the agreements
- Treat your emotional reaction as equivalent to a rule violation

If your primary goal is to make sure you and others are safe, you're in defense. If your primary goal is to make the other person pay, you're in aggression—even if you're calling it "holding them accountable."

When you're activated and angry, it's easy to blur this line. That's why we name it upfront: strong emotions are welcome, defensive actions are protected, but using an incident as license to attack will not be tolerated.

### The Key Distinction

**Mistakes made in good faith** → Protected. Work through it. Learn. Stay.

**Intentional harm or repeated violations** → Not protected. Asked to leave.

This isn't about being harsh. It's about being clear. When people know exactly where the lines are, they can relax inside them.

### Why This Benefits You (The Facilitator)

These rules aren't just for participants. They're for you.

**Clarity on when to act:** When you've clearly stated what will result in removal, you don't have to agonize over decisions in the moment. Someone threatens violence? You already said that's grounds for removal. Done. No second-guessing.

**Accountability to your own values:** Writing it down and sharing it publicly keeps you honest. If you say "threats of violence result in removal" but then let it slide because you're scared of the person, a participant can point to your own rules and help you walk your talk.

**A reference when you're unsure:** In the heat of a situation, you can ask yourself: "Did they violate one of my stated rules?" If yes, act. If no, work through it. The list becomes your decision-making framework.

**Protection from accusations of targeting:** When everyone knows the rules upfront, your enforcement looks like consistency, not personal vendetta.

### Communicate This Early

This should be communicated at the very beginning of your container—before anything happens. Not after someone makes a mistake. Not as a reaction to conflict.

When it's established upfront, it's a framework for safety. When it's announced mid-conflict, it looks like targeting.

### Example: How to Present This

Here's language you might use at the opening of your container:

> "Before we begin, I want to make a sacred promise to you.
>
> This promise is the foundation everything else rests on. It's the prime directive of this container. Every decision I make as your facilitator will orient around it.
>
> **Here is my promise:**
>
> **As long as you operate in good faith—communicating honestly, respecting stated boundaries, checking in when uncertain, and treating others with dignity—you are safe here. I have your back.**
>
> You can make mistakes. You can try things that don't work. You can get triggered and need to step away. You can not know things you 'should' know. None of that will get you removed. You are protected.
>
> **There are five things that will break this protection:**
>
> 1. Threats or acts of physical violence—verbal, physical, or implied through body language. Interpretation is up to me, not up for debate.
> 2. Intentional malice—deliberately trying to harm someone
> 3. Repeated boundary violations after being told to stop
> 4. Using victim status as an excuse to attack—yours or someone else's. Victim status is not a license to attack.
> 5. Character assassination or triangulation—trying to destroy someone's reputation or get others to gang up on them
>
> If you cross these lines, I cannot guarantee your place here.
>
> **One exception:** In rare cases, I may need to ask someone to leave—or to step out temporarily—for emergency safety reasons, even if they haven't broken these rules. This isn't punishment; it's protection. If I ever need to do this, I'll explain why, and it won't affect your standing in future events. This exception exists for genuine emergencies—not as a loophole for arbitrary removal.
>
> **One more thing:** If something goes wrong—if someone crosses a boundary—you have every right to strong emotions. You have every right to remove yourself, protect yourself, and report to us. These are defensive actions and they're always acceptable.
>
> What's not acceptable is using an incident as an excuse to attack. If your response shifts from protecting yourself to punishing someone else—public attacks, mobilizing others, demanding removal based on anger—that's aggression, not defense. Even if you're angry, even if the incident was real.
>
> **This is my promise. This is my commitment. This is the ground we stand on.**
>
> Inside these lines, you are safe. Outside them, you are not. Know where they are, and you can relax inside them."

You can adapt this language to your style. The key is: **say it early, say it clearly, and put it in writing if possible.**
